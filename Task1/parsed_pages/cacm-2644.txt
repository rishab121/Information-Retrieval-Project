a theorem-proving language for experimentation

because of the large number of strategies
and inference rules presently under consideration 
in automated theorem proving there is a need for developing
a language especially oriented toward automated 
theorem proving  this paper discusses some of the features
and instructions of this language  the use 
of this language permits easy extension of automated
theorem-proving programs to include new strategies 
and/or new inference rules  such extend ability will
permit general experimentation with the various 
alternative systems
