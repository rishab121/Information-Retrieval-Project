the synthesis of solids bounded by many faces

a technique is presented which allows a class
of solid objects to be synthesized and stored 
using a computer  synthesis begins with primitive solids
like a cube wedge or cylinder  any solid 
can be moved scaled or rotated  solids may also be
added together or subtracted  two algorithms to 
perform addition are described  for practical designers
the technique has the advantage that operations 
are concise readily composed and are given in terms
of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences 
of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces
