improved event-scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulation

simulation models of large complex real-world
applications have occasionally earned the 
reputation of eating up hours of computer time  this
problem may be attributed in part to difficulties 
such as slow stochastic convergence  however an additional
problem lies in the fact that a significant 
amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events
in their proper sequence  this paper presents 
a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning
future event lists in discrete event simulations 
 there models are presented all of which improve in effectiveness
as the events-list scan problem becomes 
more burdensome
