experiments in text file compression

a system for the compression of data files
viewed as strings of characters is presented 
 the method is general and applies equally well to
english to pl/i or to digital data  the system 
consists of an encoder an analysis program and a decoder
  two algorithms for encoding a string differ 
slightly from earlier proposals  the analysis program attempts
to find an optimal set of codes for representing 
substrings of the file  four new algorithms for this
operation are described and compared  various 
parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtain
a high degree of compression for sample texts
