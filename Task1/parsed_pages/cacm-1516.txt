automatic data compression

the information explosion noted in recent
years makes it essential that storage requirements 
for all information be kept to a minimum  a fully automatic
and rapid three-part compressor which can 
be used with any body of information to greatly reduce
slow external storage requirements and to increase 
the rate of information transmission through a computer
is described in this paper  the system will 
also automatically decode the compressed information
on an item-by-item basis when it is required  the 
three component compressors which can be used separately
to accomplish their specific tasks are discussed 
nupak for the automatic compression of numerical data anpak
for the automatic compression of any information 
and iopak for further compression of information to be stored on tape or cards
