data base management systems have grown rapidly
in their power and complexity over the 15-year 
history of data processing on commercially available
computers  the original concepts have split and 
new terms have been adopted to name and refer to these
concepts  the data structure diagram graphic 
technique is used to illustrate the splitting of the
concepts and the structural relations which exist 
between these concepts at each point in the evolution
