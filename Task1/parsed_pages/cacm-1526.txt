multiprogramming under a page on demand strategy

a model of multiprogramming for a particular
computer system using a page on demand strategy 
is developed  analysis of this model is used to predict
performance measured by the average usage of 
the cpu when user programs are typical of those arising
from an interactive time sharing environment 
 the effect of several hardware modifications is also
analyzed  a parameter readily calculated from 
the hardware characteristics and the program statistics
is proposed for gauging the effect of multiprogramming
