fingers or fists the choice of decimal or binary representation

the binary number system offers many advantages
over a decimal representation for a high-performance 
general-purpose computer  the greater simplicity of
a binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness 
of binary numbers both contribute directly to arithmetic
speed  less obvious and perhaps more important 
is the way binary addressing and instruction formats can
increase the overall performance  binary addresses 
are also essential to certain powerful operations which
are not practical with decimal instruction formats 
 on the other hand decimal numbers are essential for
communicating between man and the computer  in 
applications requiring the processing of a large volume
of inherently decimal input and output data 
the time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely
binary computer may be significant  a slower 
decimal adder may take less time than a fast binary adder
doing an addition and two conversions  a careful 
review of the significance of decimal and binary addressing
and both binary and decimal data arithmetic 
supplemented by efficient conversion instructions
