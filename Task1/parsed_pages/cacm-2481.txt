the distribution of a program in primary and fast buffer storage

a virtual memory computer system with a fast
buffer cache memory between primary memory and 
the central processing unit is considered  the optimal
distribution of a program between the buffer 
and primary memory is studied using the programs lifetime
function  expressions for the distribution 
of a program which maximizes the useful fraction of
the cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer 
storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies
