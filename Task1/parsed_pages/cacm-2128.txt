a processor allocation method for time-sharing

a scheduling algorithm is proposed which is intended to minimize changes of 
tasks on processors and thereby reduce over-head  the algorithm also has
application to more general resource allocation problems  it is implemented 
by means of a method for efficiently handling dynamically changing segmented 
lists
