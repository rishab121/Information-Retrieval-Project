aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real 
world  aggregation transforms a relationship between
objects into a higher-level object  a new data 
type called aggregation is developed which under
certain criteria of well-definedness specifies 
aggregation abstractions  relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations  to main tain well-definedness
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants  well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form  it 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design  a top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification  it is
suggested that aggregate types and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail should be incorporated 
into programming languages
