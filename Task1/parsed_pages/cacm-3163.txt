an optimal insertion algorithm for one-sided
height-balanced binary search trees

an algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced
oshb binary search tree is presented  the algorithm operates in time 
olog n where n is the number of nodes in
the tree  this represents an improvement over the best previous
ly known insertion algorithms of hirschberg and kosaraju which require
time olog 2n  moreover the olog n complexity is optimal earlier 
results have shown that deletion in such a structure can
also be performed in olog n time  thus the result of this paper
gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should
be the first examples of their kind where deletion has a smaller time 
complexity than insertion  furthermore it can now be concluded
that insertion deletion and retrieval in oshb trees can
be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for
the more general avl trees to within a constant factor  however
the insertion and deletion algorithms for oshb trees appear much
more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for avl trees
