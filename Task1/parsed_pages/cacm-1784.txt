practical error coefficients for estimating
quadrature errors for analytic functions

all published error coefficients for estimating
quadrature errors for analytic functions were 
computed on the assumption that the quadrature rule
was exact for polynomials up to a given degree  
since these rules use rounded values for the abscissas and
weights and since the true values of the integrals 
of some of the polynomials in question have an infinite
binary expression the quadrature rule is not 
exact  hence these errors must be taken into consideration
in computing practical error coefficients
