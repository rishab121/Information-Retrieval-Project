execution characteristics of programs in a page-on-demand system

data are presented which show the execution characteristics
of two types of commonly used programs 
in a large-scale time-shared computer system  a software
monitoring facility built into the supervisor 
was used for data collection during normal system operation
 these data were analyzed and results of 
this analysis are presented for a fortran compiler
and an interactive line file editor  probability 
distribution functions and other data are given for
such things as cpu intervals i/o intervals and 
the number of such intervals during execution  empirical
distributions are compared with simple theoretical 
distributions exponential hyperexponential and geometric
 other data show paging characteristics 
of tasks as a function of the number of pages those tasks have in core
