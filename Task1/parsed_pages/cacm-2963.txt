a fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequences

previously published algorithms for finding
the longest common subsequence of two sequences 
of length n have had a best-case running time of on^2
 an algorithm for this problem is presented 
which has a running time of or + nlog n where r
is the total number of ordered pairs of positions 
at which the two sequences match  thus in the worst
case the algorithm has a running time of on^2 log 
n  however for those applications where most positions
of one sequence match relatively few positions 
in the other sequence a running time of on log n can be expected
