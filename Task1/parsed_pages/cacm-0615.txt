addressing multidimensional arrays

a useful method of representing a function of
n variables is to consider the function to assume 
its values at selected points in n-dimensional space
 although this picture is of value to the analyst 
the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist in
conventional storage as a linear array or vector 
 the means of performing the transformation of a set
of indices locating on array element in n-space 
to the location address of the element in its storage
vector is the subject of this paper  it is noted 
that the index address transformation is computationally
identical to the conversion of a number from 
a fixed to a mixed radix number system  several ways
of implementing the transformation are described
