a simple user-oriented compiler source language
for programming automatic test equipment

for the nonprogrammer difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions  a simple language even
if inelegant which considers the users background 
as part of the problem may be more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities  the language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment  because this testing process contains few
complex ideas there is little need for the elegance 
and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented language
 a simple and direct language will suffice for the 
problem  the eventual users of this language are military
depot personnel who cannot he expected to 
have computer programming skill or significant programming
training  for this nonprogramming-oriented 
user it was essential to create a language using familiar
engineering statements programming-oriented 
conventions would have unnecessarily complicated his task
