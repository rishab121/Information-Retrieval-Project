a queuing model of a multiprogrammed
computer with a two-level storage system

the results are presented of an analysis of
a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer 
system with a two-level storage system in which there
is sequential dependency of accesses between the 
devices  expressions are obtained for the long-run probability
that both the cpu and each of the storage 
devices are busy  some numerical results are given which
quantify the gains in cpu utilization obtainable 
by multiprogramming in the presence of this type of storage system
