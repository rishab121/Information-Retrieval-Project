how to share a secret

in this paper we show how to divide data d into
n pieces in such a way that d is easily reconstructable from any
k pieces but even complete knowledge of k  1 pieces reveals
olutely no information about d  this technique enables the construction
of robust key management schemes for cryptographic systems
that can function securely and reliably even when misfortunes destroy
half the pieces and security breaches expose all but one of the
remaining pieces
