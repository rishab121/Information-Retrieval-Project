simulation of radioisotope scans by computer

in radioisotope scanning a field which is assuming
increasing importance in medical diagnosis 
the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots
 areas of increased source activity are represented 
on the scan by areas of increased dot density  to study
the output of scanners with various characteristics 
a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been
written  for a pdp-1 computer with auxiliary disk 
storage and cathode ray tube display  past and present
research using the output of the simulator has 
shown the flexibility of the system to be important
 the structure of this program can be useful in 
the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system
