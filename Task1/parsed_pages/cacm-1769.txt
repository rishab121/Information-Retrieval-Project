the expanding world of computers

the onward sweep of automatic processing of
information is impeded by nine principal barriers 
geography cost problem complexity man-machine communication
inadequate sensors lack of understanding 
distance time and size  the main incentive for breaching
these barriers is the universal need for 
processing information ever more urgent as the greater
part of human work activity changes from production 
to service  computer developments in hardware programming
time-sharing education data communication 
and displays are judged by how effectively they remove these
barriers and their barrier-smashing potentialities 
indicate continued rapid expansion  problem-oriented
languages are particularly effective over the entire 
front  online computers and time-sharing also rate high
by this measure  education and increased understanding 
are basic to all progress with the computer  this complex
but powerful tool is the most important one 
available to governments and scientists to use in studying
the problems being created by the population 
explosion and in analyzing possible solutions
