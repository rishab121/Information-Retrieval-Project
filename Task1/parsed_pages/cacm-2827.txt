a parametric algorithm for drawing pictures
of solid objects composed of quadric surfaces

an algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensional
objects with surfaces made up of patches 
of quadric surfaces is described  the emphasis of
this algorithm is on calculating the intersections 
of quadric surfaces a parameterization scheme is used
 each quadric surface intersection curve qsic 
is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter
limits  each value of the parameter represents 
at most two points and these may easily be distinguished
 this scheme can find the coordinates of points 
of even quartic fourth-order intersection curves using
equations of no more than second order  methods 
of parameterization for each type of osic are discussed
as well as surface bounding and hidden surface 
removal
