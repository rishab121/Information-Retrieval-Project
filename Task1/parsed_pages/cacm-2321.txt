on the interface between computers and data communications systems

future systems that combine computers digital
terminals and communications equipment present 
design optimization problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems  several standard interfaces
by means of which computers and digital 
terminals connect to the communications systems will
be required  when specifying these interfaces 
consideration must be given to problems of coordination
synchronization error control signaling stream 
multiplexing and switch control in addition to minimizing
the technological interdependence of specific 
subsystem designs  a focus on some of the problems is
obtained in a discussion of a detailed specification 
for a particular computer-communications system interface
