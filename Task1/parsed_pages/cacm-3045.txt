a simple recovery-only procedure for simple precedence parsers

a simple method is described enabling simple
precedence parsers to recover from syntax errors 
 no attempt to repair errors is made yet parsing and
most semantic processing can continue  the result 
is a good first approximation to syntax error handling
with negligible increase in parsing time space 
and complexity of both the parser and its table generator
