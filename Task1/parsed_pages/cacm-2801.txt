storage-efficient representation of decimal data

usually n decimal digits are represented by
4n bits in computers  actually two bcd digits 
can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits
and three digits into 10 bits by a very simple 
algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of two
variable field-length encodings  in over half 
of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional
bcd code by simple removal of redundant 
0 bits  a long decimal message can be subdivided into
three-digit blocks and separately compressed 
the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length
by only 0.34 percent  the hardware requirement 
is small and the mappings can be done manually
