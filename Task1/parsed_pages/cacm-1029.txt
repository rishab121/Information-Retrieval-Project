a simple automatic derivative evaluation program

a procedure for automatic evaluation of total/partial
derivatives of arbitrary algebraic functions 
is presented  the technique permits computation of
numerical values of derivatives without developing 
analytical expressions for the derivatives  the key
to the method is the decomposition of the given 
function by introduction of intermediate variables
into a series of elementary functional steps  a 
library of elementary function subroutines is provided
for the automatic evaluation and differentiation 
of these new variables  the final step in this process
produces the desired functions derivative  
the main feature of this approach is its simplicity
 it can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the 
derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and
also as a debugging tool for programs which contain 
derivatives
