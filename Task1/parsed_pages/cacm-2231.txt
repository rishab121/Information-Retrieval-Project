the reconstruction of binary patterns from their projections

given the horizontal and vertical projections
of a finite binary pattern f can we construct 
the original pattern f  in this paper we give a characterization
of patterns that are reconstructable 
from their projection  three algorithms are developed
to reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous 
patterns  it is shown that an unambiguous pattern can
be perfectly reconstructed in time m x n and that 
a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed
in time m x n where m n are the dimensions 
of the pattern frame
