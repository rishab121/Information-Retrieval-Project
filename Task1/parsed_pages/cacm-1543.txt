computer formulation of the equations of motion using tensor notation

a means is described for extending the area
of application of digital computers beyond the 
numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for
human participation in the formulation of certain 
types of computer problems  by the use of tensor calculus
and a computer language designed to facilitate 
symbolic mathematical computation a method has been
devised whereby a digital computer can be used to 
do non-numeric work that is symbolic algebraic manipulation
and differentiation to illustrate the 
techniques involved a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass 
in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system
 since this operation involves a formulation in 
terms of first and second-order differential coefficients
it provides a good demonstration of a computers 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the 
numerical data processing stage  moreover this particular
problem serves to illustrate the advantages 
of the mathematical techniques employed  with the program
prepared for this purpose the computer will 
derive the equations of motion in any coordinate system
requested by the user   results are presented 
for the following coordinate systems cylindrical
polar spherical polar and prolate spheroidal
