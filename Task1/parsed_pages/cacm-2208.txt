storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storage
assignment is performed by a hashing algorithm

the utilization of storage is studied in a two-level
memory hierarchy  the first storage level 
which is the fast store is divided into a number of
storage areas  when an entry is to be filed in 
the hierarchy a hashing algorithm will attempt to
place the entry into one of these areas  if this 
particular area is full then the entry will be placed
into the slower second-level store even though 
other areas in the first-level store may have space
available  given the n entries have been filed in 
the entire hierarchy an expression is derived for the
expected number of entries filed in the first-level 
storehis expression gives a measure of how effectively
the first-level store is being used  by means 
of examples storage utilization is then studied as a
function of the hashing algorithm the number of 
storage areas into which the first-level store is divided
and the total size of the first-level store
