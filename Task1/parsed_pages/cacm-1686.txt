computer synthesis of holograms for 3-d display

optical and digital holography are reviewed
 the mathematical model and computational techniques 
of the authors digital holographic process are discussed
and applications of computer holography are 
suggested  computer holograms have been made of three-dimensional
objects which give faithful reconstructions 
even in white light  a new approach based on point
apertures for the image is discussed  photographs 
of the images reconstructed from digital holograms are presented
