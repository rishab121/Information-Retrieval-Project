the use of a front-end minicomputer to provide
varied remote terminal access to a large scale 
computer is considered  the problems of embedding
telecommunications i/o within an operating system 
are discussed and it is shown how the decentralization

vastly simplifies the problem  a specific implementation is
discussed with emphasis on the main processor-minicomputer
