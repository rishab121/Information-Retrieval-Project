flowtrace a computer program for flowcharting programs

the flowtrace system produces flowcharts of programs
written in almost any programming language 
 one most describe the syntax of the control statements
in his language for this purpose a metalanguage 
is available  the resultant object deck is used to
flowchart any programs in the language described 
 several examples of fap and snobol flowcharts are given
 however it is not necessary to confine ones 
scope to existing languages  one may define his own
language in any well-structured manner  this 
feature is particularly useful when it is desirable
to chart only comments within a program  such an 
approach permits the documentation of descriptive remarks
and avoids the inclusion of coding details
