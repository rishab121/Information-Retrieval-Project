an experimental evaluation of data type conventions

the language in which programs are written
can have a substantial effect on the reliability 
of the resulting programs  this paper discusses an experiment
that compares the programming reliability 
of subjects using a statically typed language and a typeless
language  analysis of the number of errors 
and the number of runs containing errors shows that at
least in one environment the use of a statically 
typed language can increase programming reliability 
detailed analysis of the errors made by the subjects 
in programming solutions to reasonably small problems
shows that the subjects had difficulty manipulating 
the representation of data
