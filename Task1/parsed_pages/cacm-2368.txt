an implemented graph algorithm for winning shannon switching games

in this tutorial paper a computer program
which wins shannon switching games is described
 since these games are played on graphs the program
is a good example of the implementation of graph 
algorithms  the two players in a shannon switching game
connect and cut have nonsimilar goals  either 
connect cut or the player moving first is guaranteed
the existence of a winning strategy  the simple 
strategy explained in this paper is valid in all three
cases  in fact the major routines never need 
to know whether the computer is connect or cut
