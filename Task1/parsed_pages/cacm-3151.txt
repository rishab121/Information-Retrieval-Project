an optimal real-time algorithm for planar convex hulls

an algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of the
convex hull of a set of n points in the plane   using an appropriate data
structure the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive
updates each taking time olog n thereby achieving a total
processing time on log n
