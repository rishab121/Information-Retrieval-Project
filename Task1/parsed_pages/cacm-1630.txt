computer representation of planar regions by their skeletons

any region can be regarded as a union of maximal
neighborhoods of its points and can be specified 
by the centers and radii of these neighborhoods this
set is a sort ofskeleton of the region  the 
storage required to represent a region in this way is
comparable to that required when it is represented 
by encoding its boundary  moreover the skeleton representation
seems to have advantages when it is 
necessary to determine repeatedly whether points are inside
or outside the region or to perform set-theoretic 
operations on regions
