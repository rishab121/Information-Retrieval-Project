analysis of boolean program models for time-shared paged environments

directed graphs or their associated matrices are
frequently used to represent the logical structure 
of sequences of computer instructions  such techniques
are used and in addition data references are 
represented in a nondirected model the complete structural
specification of a program is represented 
by a combined model  a transformation of the combined
model yields a new model in which additional timing 
information is also contained  analysis of these models
prior to execution yields information valuable 
in determining segmentation of instructions and data for
a time-shared environment as well as for initial 
page loading during execution the analysis may be
used for look ahead control of page turning
