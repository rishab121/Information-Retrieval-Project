operations on generalized arrays with the genie compiler

operations on vectors matrices and higher dimensional storage arrays are 
standard features of most compilers today  the elements of such structures are
usually restricted to be scalars  for many sophisticated applications
this restriction can impose cumbersome data representations
an efficient system has been devised and implemented which allows
the elements of multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensional
arrays  this system was developed from a storage structure
in which the location length and content of each array is described
by a codeword which can be interpreted by the system  code words may describe 
arrays containing more codewords thus providing
all needed descriptive information for hyperstructures of any form
