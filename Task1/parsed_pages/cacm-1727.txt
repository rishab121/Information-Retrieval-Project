one way of estimating frequencies of jumps in a program

for the segmentation of a program it is useful
to have a reasonable estimation of the values 
of sij where sij is the mean value of the number
of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th 
instruction in the run time  in the cases where the
sij are estimated directly the structure of the 
whole program must be generally taken into account
therefore it is very difficult for the programmer 
and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of
the sij  it is easier to estimate not sij but 
the quantities pijsijci/sumsij j1n where
ci is an arbitrary positive constant for each 
i  although the pij are for each i proportional to
sij the estimation of pij is easier because 
we must estimate only the probabilities of events
where instruction i is executed after instruction 
ii  this estimation can often be done without considering
the structure of the whole program  in 
the first part of the paper using the theory of the
markov chains an algorithm for the computation 
of the sij from the pij is found and some ways
of obtaining estimates of the pij are given  in 
the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived
avoiding the necessity of computation involving 
large matrices
