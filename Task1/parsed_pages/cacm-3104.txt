test data as an aid in proving program correctness

proofs of program correctness tend to be long
and tedious whereas testing though useful in 
detecting errors usually does not guarantee correctness
 this paper introduces a techniques whereby 
test data can be used in proving program correctness
 in addition to simplifying the process of proving 
correctness this method simplifies the process of providing
accurate specification for a program  the 
applicability of this technique to procedures
and recursive programs is demonstrated
