a note on compiling fixed point binary multiplications

an algorithm is developed for compiling as
a sequence of shifts additionsand subtractions 
many fixed point binary multiplications involving a
constant  the most significant characteristics of 
the algorithm are the simplicity of the test which
determines if the algorithm should be applied and 
the degree to which it suggests efficient object code
