an efficient list-moving algorithm using constant workspace

an efficient algorithm is presented for moving
arbitrary list structures using no storage 
apart from program variables other than that required
to hold the original list and the copy  the 
original list is destroyed as it is moved  no mark
bits are necessary but pointers to the copy must 
be distinguishable from pointers to the original  the
algorithm is superior in execution speed to previous 
algorithms for the same problem  some variations
and extensions of the algorithm are discussed
