quasilinearization and the estimation
of differential operators from eigenvalues

given a linear ordinary differential operator
containing several unknown constants and a number 
of its eigenvalues the values of the unknown constants
are estimated  a precise formulation is provided 
and an effective numerical procedure for solution is indicated
  the results of some computational experiments 
are given
