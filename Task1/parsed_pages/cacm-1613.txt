one-pass compilation of arithmetic expressions for a parallel processor

under the assumption that a processor may have
a multiplicity of arithmetic units a compiler 
for such a processor should produce object code to take
advantage of possible parallelism of operation 
 most of the presently known compilation techniques
are inadequate for such a processor because they 
produce expression structures that must be evaluated serially
 a technique is presented here for compiling 
arithmetic expressions into structures that can be
evaluated with a high degree of parallelism  the 
algorithm is a variant of the so-called top-down
analysis technique and requires only one pass of
