feedback coupled resource allocation policies
in the multiprogramming multiprocessor computer 
system

model studies of some integrated feedback-driven
scheduling systems for multiprogrammed multiprocessor 
computer systems are presented  the basic control variables
used are the data-flow rates for the processes 
executing on the cpu  the model systems feature simulated
continuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling 
of input-output activity  attention is given to the
amount of memory resource required for effective 
processing of the i/o activity buffer space assignment
 the model studies used both distribution-driven 
and trace-driven techniques  even relatively simple dynamic
schedulers are shown to improve system performance 
as measured by user cpu time over that given by optimal
or near-optimal static schedulers imbeded 
in identical system structures and workload environments
 the improvement is greatest under a heavy 
i/o demand workload
