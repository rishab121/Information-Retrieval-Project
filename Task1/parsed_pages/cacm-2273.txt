conversion of decision tables by rule mask method without rule mask

two algorithms for generating computer programs
from decision tables are described  the algorithms 
allow handling limited entry extended entry and mixed
entry tables  the algorithms are based on the 
rule mask method but need not have the masks at execution
time  they perform the logical operations 
immediately rather than at the end of the interpreting
process  execution time can be considerably reduced 
by instantly marking rules which are not applicable algorithms
1 and 2 or conditions which are already 
tested algorithm 2  the new algorithms combine to a
certain degree the advantages of mask methods with 
those of tree methods
