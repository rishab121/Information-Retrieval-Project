the multistore parser for hierarchical syntactic structures

a syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns
that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings  particular
emphasis is given to the system of significant addresses by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced  the description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental english sentence analyzer  by structuring
an area of the computers central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether  the matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure  the method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures
