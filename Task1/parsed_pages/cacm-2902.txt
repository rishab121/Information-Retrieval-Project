dynamic memory allocation in computer simulation

this paper investigates the performance of
35 dynamic memory allocation algorithms when used 
to service simulation programs as represented by 18
test cases  algorithm performance was measured in
terms of processing time memory usage and external memory
fragmentation  algorithms main taining separate 
free space lists for each size of memory block used
tended to perform quite well compared with other 
algorithms  simple algorithms operating on memory ordered
lists without any free list performed surprisingly 
well  algorithms employing power-of-two block sizes
had favorable processing requirements but generally 
unfavorable memory usage  algorithms employing lifo fifo
or memory ordered free lists generally performed 
poorly compared with others
