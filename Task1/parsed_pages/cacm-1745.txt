a position paper on computing and communications

the effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments 1 the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing
communications and the development of information 
services 2 the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable and 3 the development 
of public message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security
