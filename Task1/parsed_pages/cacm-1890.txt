simulation of traffic flows in a network

a computer simulation program which deals
with traffic flows in the network of a large area 
is described  each road is segmented into blocks of
several ten-meter lengths and is represented by 
a bidirectional list in computer memory  the movement
of cars ie the transfer of cars from one block 
to the next is expressed by a proper formula  this
formula is based on the supposition that the speed 
of cars in a block is determined only by the density of
cars in the block and this speed-versus-density 
curve is empirically given the numerical values  this
simulation scheme has its excellent point in that 
it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behavior
of traffic flows in a variety of situations some 
examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of kyoto japan
