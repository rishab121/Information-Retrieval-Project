thinning algorithms on rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays

in this report three thinning algorithms are
developed one each for use with rectangular 
hexagonal and triangular arrays  the approach to the
development of each algorithm is the same  pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared  it is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive 
to image irregularities and noise yet it will yield
a thinned image with an overall reduced number of 
points  it is concluded that the algorithm operating in
conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays
