jump searching a fast sequential search technique

when sequential file structures must be used
and binary searching is not feasible jump searching 
becomes an appealing alternative  this paper explores
variants of the classic jump searching scheme 
where the optimum jump size is the square root of the
number of records  multiple level and variable 
size jump strategies are explored appropriate applications
are discussed and performance is evaluated
