professionalism in the computing field

the term professional means different things
to different people nevertheless there are certain 
general technical and social standards normally associated
with a professional  further the term is 
more generally applied to the practitioner rather than
to the researcher  but within the rather broad 
definition specified the computing practitioner is
as yet not regarded as a professional  each of 
the four types of institutions-academic industry government
and the professional society that educate
employ regulate and mold the practitioner contributes
to the nonprofessional status of the computing 
practitioner  the roles of these institutions are examined
various shortcomings are noted and recommended 
changes are suggested  in the last analysis professional
status is not bestowed it is earned  however 
universities and industry specifically can make certain
 improvements to help the computing practitioner 
achieve professional status
