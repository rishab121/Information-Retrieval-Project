elimination of special functions from differential equations

a set of ordinary differential equations which
contains mathematical functions requiring the 
use of subroutines for numerical solution by electronic
computer tabular data for numerical solution 
by hand calculation or function generators when analog
methods are applied can sometimes be expanded 
to an equivalent set of equations which do not contain
the functions  this is practical if these functions 
satisfy sufficiently simple differential equations 
thus among those functions which can be eliminated 
by this procedure are the trigonometric inverse trigonometric
exponential and many other transcendental 
functions
