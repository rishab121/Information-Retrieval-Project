dynamic verification of operating system decisions

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software  the dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the prime system
being designed and constructed at the university 
of california berkeley  prime is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability data privacy and cost effectiveness
 the technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault  furthermore
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other  on prime
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one users information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software faultthe amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest
