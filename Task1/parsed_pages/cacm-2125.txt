a note on minimal length polygonal approximation to a digitized contour

a method for extracting a smooth polygonal
contour from a digitized image is illustrated
the ordered sequence of contour points and the connection graph of
the image are first obtained by a modified ledley algorithm in one
image scan  a minimal perimeter polygon subjected to specified constraints
is then chosen as the approximating contour  the determination of the minimal 
polygon can be reduced to a nonlinear programming
problem solved by an algorithm which takes into account
the weak bonds between variables  some examples are presented
and the corresponding computing times are listed
