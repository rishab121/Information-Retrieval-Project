performance of rollback recovery systems under intermittent failures

a mathematical model of a transaction-oriented
system under intermittent failures is proposed 
 the system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing
and rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable 
information processing  the model is used to derive the
principal performance measures including availability 
response time and the system saturation point
