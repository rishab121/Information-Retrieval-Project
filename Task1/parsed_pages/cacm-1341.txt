levels of computer systems

in building current computer systems we tend
to break them down into levels of control 
command and communication in using the system we break
our problems down correspondingly  the continued 
use of such a structure raises questions about its effects
on the usefulness of future systems particularly 
with regard to such trends as time sharing parallel
programming and eventually systems which learn 
 in this essay some of these questions are posed and
the general attitude we must take in pursuing the 
problem further is discussed
