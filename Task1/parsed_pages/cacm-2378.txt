an operating system based on the concept of a supervisory computer

an operating system which is organized as a
small supervisor and a set of independent processes 
are described  the supervisor handles i/o with external
devices-the file and directory system-schedules 
active processes and manages memory handle errors and
provides a small set of primitive functions which 
it will execute for a process  a process is able to
specify a request for a complicated action on the 
part of the supervisor usually a wait on the occurrence
of a compound event in the system by combining 
these primitives into a supervisory computer program
 the part of the supervisor which executes these 
programs may be viewed as a software implemented supervisory
computer  the paper develops these concepts 
in detail outlines the remainder of the supervisor and
discusses some of the advantages of this approach
