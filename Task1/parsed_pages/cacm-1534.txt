dad the c operating system

the design and implementation of the c
operating system dad is described in detail 
 this system is designed for the control data 3600 using
a large drum backing store and is intended to 
allow the integration of a remote console display subsystem
into a conventional job stack environment 
 the use of the drums the buffering of input and output
on slow peripherals and the execution of normal 
job stack work are described  the display subsystem
is described only as it integrates into the rest 
of the system  the techniques found useful in the development
of dad are given and an assessment is 
made of the validity of various design decisions  performance
figures based on several months of operation 
are tabulated
