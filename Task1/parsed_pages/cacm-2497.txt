synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated interrupts

implementations of the lock-unlock method
of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor 
system usually require uninterruptable memory-pause type instructions
 an interlock scheme called read-interlock 
which does not require memory-pause instructions has
been developed for a dual dec pdp-10 system with 
real-time requirements  the read-interlock method does
require a specialread-interlock instruction 
in the repertoire of the processors and a special read-interlock
cycle in the repertoire of the memory 
modules  when a processor examines a lock a memory
location with a read-interlock instruction it 
will be interrupted if the lock was already set examining
a lock immediately sets it if it was not already 
set this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle 
writing into a lock clears it  having the processor 
interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of
branching is advantageous if the branch would have 
resulted in an effective interrupt
