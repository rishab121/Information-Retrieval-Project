with non-integral shape parameters

when the shape parameter a is integral
generating gamma random variables with a digital 
computer is straightforward  there is no simple method
for generating gamma random variates with non-integral 
shape parameters  a common procedure is to approximately
generate such random variables by use of the 
so-called probability switch method  another procedure
which is exact is due to johnk  this paper 
presents a rejection method for exactly generating
gamma random variables when a is greater than 1  
the efficiency of the rejection method is shown to
be better than the efficiency of johnks method  
the paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following
mix of procedures yields the best combination 
of accuracy and efficiency 1 when a is less than
1 use johnks method 2 when 1 is less than a 
and a is less than 5 use the rejection method 3 when
a is greater than 5 use the probability switch 
method
