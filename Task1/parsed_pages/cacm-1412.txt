the banking information system concept

most large commercial banks have progressed to
the  point where their major accounting applications 
have been automated and more sophisticated usage of
data processing equipment is being sought  this 
coupled with the availability of equipment well suited
to real-time direct access processinghas led 
to development within some banks of the central file
of data base approach toward a banking information 
system  the banking information system now serves the
two-fold purpose of providing real-time responses 
to inquires about individual account stasus and providing
more complex combinations of information for 
management use  both kinds of processing draw upon a
common store of data contained in the direct access 
central file  this data base includes indexes which
facilitate cross referencing of account information 
so that all relationships between bank and customer may
be discerned  in introducing the banking information 
system concept a gradual approach to account cross-referencing
and file conversion is most prudent 
 generally this system must interface with other computer
applications already existing within the bank
