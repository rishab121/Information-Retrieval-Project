on multiprogramming machine coding and computer organization

the author feels that the interrupt feature
which is available in most modern computers is 
a potent source of programming pitfalls and errors and
that it therefore may heavily contribute to the 
unreliability of programs making use of it  a programming
scheme is presented which avoids the concept 
of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent
or pseudoconcurrent activities in a supposedly 
more perspicuous manner  it is intended to serve as
a basis for the construction of operating systems 
which are prime examples of programs with concurrent
activities  the scheme includes a set of basic 
instructions for the generation termination and synchronization
of parallel processes  a set of routines 
representing these instructions and thereby simulating a
hypothetical machine organization has been implemented 
and test on the ibm system/360  two programs using these
instructions written in pl360 are presented
