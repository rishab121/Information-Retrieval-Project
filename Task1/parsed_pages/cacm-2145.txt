automation of etching-pattern layout

help heuristic etching-pattern layout program
is an application program developed to computerize 
the tedious and error-prone although vitally important
wiring design of printed circuit boards  help 
helps automate a design stage one step closer to production
than logical design  it can be used to design 
wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on which
ics in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete 
components such as transistors and resistors have been
placed  help employs two methods of wiring  
one is the heuristic method which simulates human
approaches to wiring design and the other is the 
theoretically interesting but time-consuming method of
maze-running based on the lees algorithm  help 
performs more than 90 percent of required wiring by
the heuristic path with respect to a performance 
function for each point-to-point and point-to-line
connection  it can bring the number of successful 
wiring connections very close to 100 percent
