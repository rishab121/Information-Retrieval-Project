automated printed circuit routing with a stepping aperture

a computer program for routing interconnections
on a two-sided printed circuit board with a 
regular pattern of lines pins terminals and vias
feed-through holes is described  in this program 
each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically
down from the upper pin through a via and 
horizontally to the lower pin  from the top a virtual
aperture ie a long horizontal slit is stepped 
down the board  the planned routing is the basis for
rerouting interconnections within the aperture 
to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the aperture
and to maximize the effective line usage 
 if a conflict has not been resolved before the aperture
arrives at the lower pininterconnections are 
deleted to resolve the conflict  extensions of this technique
to the control of crosstalk between routed 
interconnections and to the problem of obtaining
100 percent interconnect are also discussed
