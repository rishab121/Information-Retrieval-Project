length of strings for a merge sort

detailed statistics are given on the length
of maximal sorted strings which result form the 
first internal sort phase of a merge sort onto tapes
 it is shown that the strings produced by an 
alternating method ie one which produces ascending
and descending strings alternately tend to be 
only three-fourths as long as those in a method which produces
only ascending strings contrary to statements 
which have appeared previously in the literature  a
slight modification of the read-backward polyphase 
merge algorithm is therefore suggested
