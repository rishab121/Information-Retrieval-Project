an algorithm for generating permutations

an algorithm is described which under repeated
application generates all permutations of k 
elements  only the previously generated permutation
the constant k and a temporary index are needed 
 starting with a particular ordering of k elements abcd
repeated application of the algorithm will 
generate k-1 additional permutations by k-1 successive
rotations  from the initial circular ordering 
of k objects another circular ordering can be obtained
by rotating the k-1 lowest elements  for each 
new k-1 circular ordering another k-2 can be obtained
by rotating the k-2 lowest elements  by continuing 
in this manner applications of the algorithm will generate
all k-1 circular orderings or since each 
circular ordering yields k permutations the
algorithm generates all k permutations
