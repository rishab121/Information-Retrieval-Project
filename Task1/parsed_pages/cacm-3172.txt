an algorithm for planning collision-free
paths among polyhedral obstacles

this paper describes a collision avoidance algorithm
for planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving among
known polyhedral objects  the algorithm transforms the obstacles
so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary
reference point on the moving object  a trajectory of this
reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions
trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates for each vertex 
in the transformed obstacles which other vertices can be reached safely
