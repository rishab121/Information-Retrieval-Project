counting large numbers of events in small registers

it is possible to use a small counter to keep
approximate counts of large numbers  the resulting 
expected error can be rather precisely controlled  an
example is given in which 8-bit counters bytes 
are used to keep track of as many as 130,000 events with
a relative error which is substantially independent 
of the number n of events  this relative error can
be expected to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of 
the time ieo  n/8  the techniques could be used
to advantage in multichannel counting hardware 
or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes
