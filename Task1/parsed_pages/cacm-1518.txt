an experimental model of system/360

the problem of predicting the performance of
modern computer systems is formidable  one general 
technique which can ease this problem is macroscopic simulation
 this paper reports on the applicability 
of that technique to system/360  the paper describes
an experimental model of system/360-its hardware 
software and its environment  the measures of system performance
produced by the model consist of statistics 
relating to turnaround time throughput hardware utilization
software utilization and queueing processes 
 the model is mechanized in simscript and consists of
some 1750 statements  an auxiliary programs the 
job generator creates automatically the properties
of system/360 jobs that get simulated
