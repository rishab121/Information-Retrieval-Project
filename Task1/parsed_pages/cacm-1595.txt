on the computer enumeration of finite topologies

the problem of enumerating the number of topologies
which can be formed from a finite point 
set is considered both theoretically and computationally
 certain fundamental results are established 
leading to an algorithm for enumerating finite topologies
and computed results are given for n  7 
 an interesting side result of the computational work
was the unearthing of a theoretical error which 
had been induced into the literature the use of the computer
in combinatorics represents chronologically 
an early application and this side result underscores
its continuing usefulness in this area
