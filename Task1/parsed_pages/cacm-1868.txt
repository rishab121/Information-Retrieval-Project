on obtaining correct inputa new approach

most information put into machine readable
form whether from scientific or business origins 
is still keypunched  this paper is addressed toward
the difficulty of obtaining correctly keypunched 
and key verified data and an alternative method is suggested
in which the computer itself is used to rule 
out the possibility of errors in input  this technique
is explained and illustrated by reference to 
a working program which involves essentially two phases
in the first phase errors are detected by the 
machine and subsequently in the second phase they are corrected by it
