preliminary investigation of techniques
for automated reading of unformatted text

methods for converting unstructured printed
material into computer code are experimentally 
investigated  an operator-controlled mode depending
on human demarcation of the various regions of 
the page for guiding the scanner is implemented by
means of a joystick and a crt display  this mode 
for which some performance figures are obtained is thought
to be suitable for processing very complicated 
material such as technical journals  for simpler material
for instance the claims sections of patents 
and in applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary
an unsupervised mode is advocated  here 
the textual portions of the page are located during
a rapid prescan by a rudimentary form of frequency 
analysis  these areas are then rescanned at a higher
resolution suitable for character recognition 
 error rates of the order of 0.1 percent are obtained in
a simple problem involving photographs of telephone 
company meter boards  other matters related to the
design of a general purpose page reader such as 
the segmentation of printed text the possibility of
time-sharing the scanner interactive man-machine 
operation and the facsimile reproduction of illustrations are discussed
