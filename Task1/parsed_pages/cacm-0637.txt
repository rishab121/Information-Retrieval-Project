a neliac-generated 7090-1401 compiler

neliac systems for several different machines
have been generated using the original neliac 
system developed at the naval electronics laboratory
san diego in 1958  a basic bootstrap process 
was used to generate all but the first ie the systems
were described in the neliac language and generated 
by an existing neliac compiler  this experience has
shown there is no inherent difficulty in building 
compilers with compilers indeed it pointed out many advantages
in using a pol for constructing programming 
systems  this report presents the results of a project
completed in may 1961 in which the neliac system 
was used to generate a compiler for the ibm 1401  the
1401 compiler which runs on the 7090 and produces 
1401 programs was described in the neliac language and
generated with 7090 neliac system  the reduction 
in programming time and the improvement in documentation
of the system were very significant
