scheduling university course examinations by computer

a new approach to the problem of scheduling
course examinations is presented  in principle 
an examination schedule which requires a minimum number
of examination periods and satisfies the constraint 
that no student be required to take two examinations
simultaneously can be found in two steps  first 
course which may have their examinations scheduled at
the same period are grouped together in all possible 
ways  then a minimum number of these groups such that
each course is included at least once are selected 
 by removing multiple occurrences of courses and then scheduling
each group at a different period a minimal 
schedule can be obtained  known algorithms for carrying
out these procedures are prohibitively expensive 
 approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above are
given which yield nonminimal but feasible schedules 
with a very small expenditure of time  results of experiments
using these techniques are given  these 
are encouraging and indicate that further experimentation would be worthwhile
