the use of normal multiplication tables
for information storage and retrieval

this paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute 
based information systems using the normal multiplication table as a directory
for the information system  algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval of information are described  this method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes and possibly
some other attributes as well  several examples are given the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches  algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described  for a certain class of information systems
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems  
moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted 
file technique
