generating discrete random variables in a computer

this note is concerned with details of how to
instruct a computer to choose one from many things 
with assigned probabilities  the method uses a uniform
variable to direct the computer to a memory location 
if this is done by a sequence of appropriately chosen
conditional probabilities efficient use of memory 
space and quite fast programs will result
