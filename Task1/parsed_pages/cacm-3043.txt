distributed processes a concurrent programming concept

a language concept for concurrent processes
without common variables is introduced  these 
processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure
calls and guarded regions  this concept 
is proposed for real-time applications controlled by
microcomputer networks with distributed storage 
 the paper gives several examples of distributed processes
and shows that they include procedures coroutines 
classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path
expressions and input/output as special cases
