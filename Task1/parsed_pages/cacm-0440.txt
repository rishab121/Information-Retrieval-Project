record linkage

special difficulties are encountered in devising
reliable systems for searching and updating 
any large files of documents that must be identified
primarily on the basis of names and other personal 
particulars  the underlying problem is that of making nearly
maximum use of items of identifying information 
that are individually unreliable but that may collectively
be of considerable discriminating power  
rules that can be applied generally to name retrieval
systems have been developed in a methodological 
study of the linkage of vital and health records into
family groupings for demographic research purposes 
 these rules are described and the ways in which information
utilization for matching may be optimized 
are discussed
