an improved program-synthesizing algorithm and its correctness

an improved program-synthesizing algorithm
based on the algorithm proposed by waldinger and 
lee in 1969 is given  in the old algorithm the program-synthesizing
problem is translated into a theorem-proving 
problem and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof
 for the improved algorithm the analysis is 
not necessary and a program is obtained as soon as
the proof is completed  this is achieved by using 
a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by green
in 1969  the correctness of the improved algorithm 
is also proved ie the program thus obtained
always satisfies the specification
