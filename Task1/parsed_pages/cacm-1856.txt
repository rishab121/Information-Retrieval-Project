the teachable language comprehender 
a simulation program and theory of language

the teachable language comprehender tlc is
a program designed to be capable of being taught 
to comprehend english text  when text which the program
has not seen before is input to it it comprehends 
that text by correctly relating each explicit or implicit
assertion of the new text to a large memory 
 this memory is a semantic network representing factual
assertions about the world  the program also 
creates copies of the parts of its memory which have
been found to relate to the new text adapting and 
combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text  by this means the meaning of all text 
the program successfully comprehends is encoded into
the same format as that of the memory  in this 
form it can be added into the memory  both factual
assertions for the memory and the capabilities for 
correctly relating text to the memorys prior content
are to be taught to the program as they are needed 
 tlc presently contains a relatively small number of
examples of such assertions and capabilities but 
within the system notations for expressing either of these
are provided  thus the program now corresponds 
to a general process for comprehending language and
it provides a methodology for adding the additional 
information this process requires to actually comprehend
text of any particular kind  the memory structure 
and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual assertions
and capabilities for relating text to such 
stored assertions to generalize automatically  that
is once such an assertion or capability is put 
into the system it becomes available to help comprehend
a great many other sentences in the future 
 thus the addition of a single factual assertion or
linguistic capability will often provide a large 
increment in tlcs effective knowledge of the world and
in its overall ability to comprehend text  the 
programs strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension
