an interactive graphical display monitor in
a batch-processing environment with remote entry

a graphic monitor program is described  it
was developed at carnegie-mellon university for 
the cdc g21 computer which is a general purpose batch-processing
system with remote entry  the existing 
g21 system and the graphics hardware are described 
the graphic monitor is a resident auxiliary monitor 
which provides comprehensive managerial capability
over the graphical system in response to commands 
from the human user  it also will respond to commands
from a user program through a similar interface 
where routine calls take the place of manual actions  thus
the human and program can interact on a symmetrical 
and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor
 the choice made in designing the graphic 
monitor given the constraints of the existing hardware
and computer system are discussed  the structure 
of the monitor program and the human and program interfaces
are described  there is also a transient 
swapping version with a small resident part
and provision for swapped used submonitors
