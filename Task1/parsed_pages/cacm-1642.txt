time sharing on a computer with a small memory

techniques to make time sharing attractive on
a computer with a small central memory are presented 
 small is taken to mean that only one user program plus
a monitor will fit into the memory at any time 
 the techniques depend on having two levels of secondary
storage level 1 several times larger than 
the main memory and quite fast and level 2
many times larger and slower than level 1
