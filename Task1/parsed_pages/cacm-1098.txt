a comparison of list-processing computer languages
including a detailed comparison of comit 
ipl-v lisp 1.5 and slip

a detailed comparison is presented of comit
ipl-v lisp 1.5 and slip  four well-known computer 
programming languages which among them exhibit all the
principal characteristics of existing list-processing 
languages  important common features of list-processing
languages are reviewed forms of data structures 
which are manipulated necessity for dynamic allocation
of storage use of pushdown stores and use of 
recursive operations  principal differences between the
four languages under consideration are detailed 
representations of data both by the programmer and within
the machine methods for storage allocation 
programming formalisms and special processes available
including arithmetic facilities and usability 
in terms of availability documentation learning aids
and debugging facilities  a rough comparison 
shows that all the languages discussed have approximately
the same speed  finally the authors give 
some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these
languages for use in particular problem applications 
concluding that no one of the languages considered is
distinctly superior in all possible list-processing 
applications
