further remarks on line segment curve-fitting using dynamic programming

in a recent paper bellman showed how dynamic
programming could be used to determine the solution 
to a problem previously considered by stone  the problem
comprises the determination given n of the 
n points of subdivision of a given interval ab and
the corresponding line segments that give the 
best least squares fit to a function gx in the interval
 bellman confined himself primarily to the 
analytical derivation suggesting briefly however
how the solution of the equation derived for each 
particular point of subdivision ui could be reduced to
a discrete search  in this paper the computational 
procedure is considered more fully and the similarities
to some of stones equations are indicated 
 it is further shown that an equation for ui involving
no minimization may be found  in addition 
it is shown how bellmans method may be applied to the
curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints 
are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve
