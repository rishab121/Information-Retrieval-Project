a simscript-fortran case study

two programs for a vehicle dispatching model
one written in 7040 simscript and the other in 
7040 fortran iv are compared the comparison is made
in terms of basic program design decisions storage 
requirements computer time used and the ease of making
changes  in the simscript program the primary 
design considerations center around the choice of model
variables model changing events and model testing 
 in the fortran program basic design problems relate
to the representation of the passage of time the 
allocation of storage and the organization of input
data  the comparison of these differently designed 
programs shows that the simscript program uses more computer
storage and more computer time but requires 
fewer program changes to introduce model revisions
