on the meaning of names in programming systems

it is assumed that there is a similarity of
function between the data names of a programming 
language and the file names of an operating system
 the two functions are discussed in terms of the 
same basic concepts in order to identify the extent
to which they overlap it is suggested that there 
is some similarity between the idea of a file directory
and a storable object of type context  manipulations 
with contexts are then discussed at length  it is noted
that there is a simple extension of churchs 
lambda notation that deals nicely with these ideas of
context manipulation  whereas a function can be 
regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
the expression lambdaname listexpressionvalue list 
it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction
based upon the first two terms in the equivalent 
expression muname listvalue listexpression
