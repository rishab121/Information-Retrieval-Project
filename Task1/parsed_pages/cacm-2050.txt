automatic parsing for content analysis

although automatic syntactic and semantic analysis is not yet possible for
all of an unrestricted natural language text some applications of which 
content analysis is one do not have such a stringent coverage requirement
preliminary studies show that the harvard syntactic analyzer can
produce correct and unambiguous identification of the subject and
object of certain verbs for approximately half of the relevant occurrences 
this provides a degree of coverage for content analysis variables which 
compares favorably to manual methods in variables which compares favorably 
to manual methods in which only a sample of the total available text is 
normally processed
