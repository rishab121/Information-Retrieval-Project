generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuits

systematic generation of a specific class
of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems 
is described  in a nonoriented complete graph with
n vertices hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5n 
 1 specific permutations of n elements termed rosary
permutations can be defined  each of them 
corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image
each other and is generated successively 
by a number system covering 34n-1 sets of edges
 every set of edges ek 1  ek  k 
3  k  n-1 is determined recursively by constructing
a hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from 
a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices starting with
the hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices  the basic 
operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent
vertices where the position of the pair in 
the permutation is determined by ek  two algorithms
treating the same example for five vertices 
are presented  it is very easy to derive all possible n
permutations  from the .5n  1  rosary permutations 
be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the
reverse order-procedures which can be performed 
fairly efficiently by computer
