further experimental data on the behavior
of programs in a paging environment

results are summarized from an empirical study
directed at the measurement of program operating 
behavior in those multiprogramming systems in which
programs are organized into fixed length pages  
the data collected from the interpretive execution of
a number of paged programs are used to describe 
the frequency of page faults ie the frequency of those
instants at which an executing program requires 
a page of data or instructions not in main core memory
 these data are used also for the evaluation 
of page replacement algorithms and for assessing the
effects on performance of changes in the amount 
of storage allocated to executing programs
