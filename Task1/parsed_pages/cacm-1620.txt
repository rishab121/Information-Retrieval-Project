methods of evaluating polynomial approximations
in function evaluation routines

the method of nested multiplication is commonly
used in function evaluation routines to evaluate 
approximation polynomials  new polynomial evaluation
methods have been developed in recent years which 
require fewer multiplications than nested multiplication
and may therefore be preferable for use in function 
evaluation routines  although some of these methods
do not appear to be practically useful because of 
rounding-error difficulties several methods of evaluating
low-degree polynomials have been found to 
be satisfactory  three such methods are described and illustrated
