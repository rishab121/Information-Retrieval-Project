thoth a portable real-time operating system 

thoth isa real-time operating system which is designed to be portable
over a large set of machines  it is currently running on two minicomputers
with quite different architectures  both the system and application
programs which use it are written in a high-level language
because the system is implemented by the same software on different
hardware it has the same interface to user programs  hence
application programs which use thoth are  highly portable  thoth
encourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes 
by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives
