protection in operating systems

a model of protection mechanisms in computing
systems is presented and its appropriateness 
is argued  the safety problem for protection systems
under this model is to determine in a given situation 
whether a subject can acquire a particular right to
an object   in restricted cases it can be shown 
that this problem is decidable ie there is an algorithm
to determine whether a system in a particular 
configuration is safe  in general and under surprisingly
weak assumptions it cannot be decided if 
a situation is safe various implications of this fact are discussed
