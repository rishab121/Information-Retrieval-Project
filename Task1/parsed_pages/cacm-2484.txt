a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method namely a set of
binary relations an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures as list tree ring 
etc  thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints
 the results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject
