attribute based file organization in a paged memory environment

the high cost of page accessing implies a need
for more careful data organization in a paged 
memory than is typical of most inverted file and similar
approaches to multi-key retrieval  this article 
analyses that cost and proposes a method called multiple
key hashing which attempts to minimize it  
since this approach is not always preferable to inversion
a combined method is described  the exact 
specifications of this combination for a file with given
data and traffic characteristics is formulated 
as a mathematical program  the proposed heuristic solution
to this program can often improve on a simple 
inversion technique by a factor of 2 or 3
