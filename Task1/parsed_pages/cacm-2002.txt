amesplot-a higher level data plotting software system

amesplot is an extensible software system designed to make the display of 
data as simple painless and neat as possible  the system described is 
hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations
of different manufacturers having diverse configurations  the elements 
common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these 
elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated
these modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot  this enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules  the
basic syntax of amesplot is outlined and a brief description is given
of its current utility software consisting of macros to produce
self-scaled plots formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots
map coastlines and 3-d plots  the system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information
and it should be fully integrable with users program written
in most conventional higher languages  the functions of positioning
locating and scaling in the layout of multiple subplots of
axes labels and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise  the structuring 
of plots from multiple independent self-contained subplots is described
transformation projection scaling rotation or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible  the user 
may interact freely with amesplot at three levels enabling him to construct 
his own data markers alphabetic characters and transformations and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects
