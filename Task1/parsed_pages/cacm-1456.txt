storage and retrieval of aspects of meaning in directed graph structures

an experimental system that uses lisp to make
a conceptual dictionary is described  the dictionary 
associates with each english word the syntactic information
definitional material and references to 
the contexts in which it has been used to define other words
 such relations as class inclusion possession 
and active or passive actions are used as definitional
material  the resulting structure serves as a 
powerful vehicle for research on the logic of question answering
 examples of methods of inputting information 
and answering simple english questions are given  an
important conclusion is that although lisp and 
other list processing languages are ideally suited for
producing complex associative structures they 
are inadequate vehicles for language processing on any
large scale-at east until they can use auxiliary 
memory as a continuous extension of core memory
