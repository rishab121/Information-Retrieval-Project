an implementation of structured walk-throughs
in teaching cobol programming

the effectiveness of structured
walk-throughs in teaching introductory cobol programming was empirically
assessed with a sample of 215 under-graduate business administration
majors  cobol proficiency was measured by a final examination
testing a knowledge of language rules b ability to read
and debug a program and c the ability to write a program  analysis
of multiple covariance was used to statistically adjust test
scores for age and conditional reasoning scores the findings provide
empirical support for incorporating structured walk-throughs
into the programming learning process more effectively
develop student proficiency in writing cobol programs
