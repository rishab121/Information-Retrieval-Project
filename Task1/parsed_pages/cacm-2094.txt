on an algorithm for nonlinear minimax approximation

certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterize
d by properties which permit the application of special algorithms
mainly based on the exchange algorithms of remes 1934 1935 for
their solution  in this paper the application to problems of this
type of a general nonlinear algorithm due to osborne and watson
1969 is considered  examples are given to illustrate that this
algorithm can give satisfactory results and in particular can
successfully solve problems which lead to difficulties
with the more conventional specialist method
