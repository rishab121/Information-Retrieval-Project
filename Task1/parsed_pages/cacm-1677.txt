storage organization in programming systems

the system of program and data representation
that has been in use on the rice university computer 
for five years is described  each logical entity in storage
occupies a block of consecutive memory locations 
 each block is labeled by a codeword and may contain
a program a data vector or codewords which in 
turn label blocks to form arrays  this storage arrangement
is discussed with its realized advantages 
or programming systems simplicity of programmed addressing
flexibility of data structures efficiency 
of memory utilization variability of system composition
during execution means of linkage between programs 
and from programs to data and basis for storage protection
 the application of labeled blocks may be 
extended to areas of time-sharing and multimedia storage
control  on the basis of experience at rice 
some ideas on such extensions are presented
