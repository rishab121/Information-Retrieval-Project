some numerical experiments using newtons method
for nonlinear parabolic and ellipticboundary-value 
problems

using a generalization of newtons method a nonlinear
parabolic equation of the form ut-uxxgu 
and a nonlinear elliptic equation uxx+uyyexpu
are solved numerically comparison of these results 
with results obtained using the picard iteration procedure
show that in many cases the quisi linearization 
method offers substantial advantages in both time and accuracy
