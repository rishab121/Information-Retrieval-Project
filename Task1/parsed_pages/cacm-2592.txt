on generation of test problems for linear programming codes

users of linear programming computer codes have
realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity 
effectiveness and accuracy of the solutions provided
by such codes  large scale linear programming 
codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct
solutions without ever having been bench-marked 
by test problems with known solutions  the reason for
this failure to adequately test the codes is that 
rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
available  this paper presents a theoretical 
justification and an illustrative implementation of a method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions  the method permits the generation
of test problems that are of arbitrary size 
and have a wide range of numerical characteristics
