computer generation of gamma random variables

a new method for generating random variables
from the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape 
parameter a is proposed  this method is similar to two
other methods recently given by wallace and fishman 
 it is compared with fishmans and ahrens and dieters methods
 the core storage requirements and programming 
effort for this method are similar to those of fishmans
method  the proposed method is the same as 
fishmans method for 1  a  2 and is faster than fishmans
method for 3  a  19  also the proposed 
method is much simpler than ahrens and dieters method and is faster for a  8
