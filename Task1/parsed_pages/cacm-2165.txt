general relativity and the application of algebraic manipulative systems

the paper describes some applications of symbolic
algebra systems to problems of general relativity 
including the derivation of the field equations the
petrov classification of a metric and the solution 
of the field equations in the presence of matter in
a simple case  attention is drawn to the strictly 
algebraic difficulties encountered in this work
