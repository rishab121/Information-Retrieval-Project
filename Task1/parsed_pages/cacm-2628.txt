minimal-total-processing time drum and disk scheduling disciplines

this article investigates the application of
minimal-total-processing-time mtpt scheduling 
disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrival
of requests is allowed  fixed-head drum and 
moving-head drum and moving-head disk storage units are
considered and emphasis is placed on the relative 
merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respect
to the shortest-latency-time-first sltf scheduling 
discipline  the results of the simulation studies
presented show that neither scheduling discipline 
is unconditionally superior to the other  for most
fixed-head drum applications the sltf discipline 
is preferable to mtpt but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling
the mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage 
over the sltf discipline  the computational requirements
of an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling 
discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms
in both cases the sorting procedure is the 
most time-consuming phase of the algorithm
