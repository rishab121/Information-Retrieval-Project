management utilization of computers in american local governments

traditional concepts of management information
systems mis bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most us local
governments  what exists is management-oriented 
computing involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications  despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems management use of computing is
surprisingly common but also varied in its extent 
among local governments  management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities  finally management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers mostly
involving improvements in decision information
