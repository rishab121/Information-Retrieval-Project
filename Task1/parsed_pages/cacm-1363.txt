a general method of systematic interval computation
for numerical integration of initial value 
problems

a procedure is given for continuously computing
and monitoring the step size to be used by 
a self-starting p-th order numerical integration method
to solve an initial value problem  the procedure 
uses an estimate of the truncation error to calculate the step size
