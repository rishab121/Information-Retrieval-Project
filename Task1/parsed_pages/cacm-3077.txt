can programming be liberated from the von neumann
style  a functional style and its algebra 
of programs

conventional programming languages are growing
ever more enormous but not stronger  inherent 
defects at the most basic level cause them to be both
fat and weak their primitive word-at-a-time style 
of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the
von neumann computer their close coupling off 
semantics to state transitions their division of programming
into a world of expressions and a world 
of statements their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs 
from existing ones and their lack of useful mathematical
properties for reasoning about programs an 
alternative functional style of programming is founded
on the use of combining forms for creating programs 
 functional programs deal with structured data are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive are hierarchically 
constructed do not name their arguments and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
to become generally applicable  combining forms can
use high level programs to build still higher level
ones in a style not possible in conventional languages
 associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms 
 this algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose unknowns are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra  these transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
in which programs are written  combining 
forms are chosen not only for their programming power
but also for the power of their associated algebraic 
laws  general theorems of of the algebra give the detailed
behavior and termination conditions for large 
classes of programs  a new class of computing systems
uses the functional programming style both in 
its programming language and in its state transition
rules  unlike von neumann languages these systems 
have semantics loosely coupled to states-only one
state transition occurs per major computation
