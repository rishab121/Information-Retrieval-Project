nonlinear regression and the solution of simultaneous equations

if one has a set of observables z1zm which
are bound in a relation with certain parameters 
a1an by an equation sz1a10 one frequently
has the problem of determining a set of 
values of the ai which minimizes the sum of squares of
differences between observed and calculated values 
of a distinguished observable say zm  if the solution
of the above equation for zm  zmnz1a1 
gives rise to a function n which is nonlinear in the ai
then one may rely on a version of gaussian regression 
1,2 for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing
set of values  it is shown here that this 
same minimization technique may be used for the solution
of simultaneous not necessarily linear equations
