regular right part grammars and their parsers

this paper in troduces an alternative to context-free
grammars called regular right part rrp 
grammars which resemble pascal syntax diagrams  formally
rrp grammars have production right parts 
which are nondeterministic finite state machines fsms
and as a special case regular expressions 
since these can be converted to fsms  rrp grammars
describe the syntax of programming languages more 
concisely and more understandably than is possible with
cf grammars  also in troduced is a class of parsers 
rrp lrm k parsers which includes the cf lrk parsers
and provides the same advantages  informally 
an rrp lrm k parser can determine the right end of
each handle by considering at most k symbols to 
the right of the handle and the left end after the
right end has been found by considering at most 
m symbols to the left of the handle  a mechanism for
determining the left end is required because there 
is no bound on the length of the handle
