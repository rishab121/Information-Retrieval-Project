n-dimensional codes for detecting and correcting multiple errors

the paper introduces a new family of codes
for detecting and correcting multiple errors in 
a binary-coded message  the message itself is arranged
conceptually into a multidimensional rectangular 
array  the processes of encoding and error detection
are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed 
dimensions of the array  effectiveness of the codes
is increased by introducing a system check bit 
which is essentially a parity check on the other parity
bits  only three-dimensional codes are discussed 
in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal
the vertical and one main diagonal  however 
the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions
as evidenced by the discussion by minnick 
and ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit
selection plan used for another purpose 6 
 a four-dimensional code correcting three and detecting
four errors has been developed the extension 
to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward
