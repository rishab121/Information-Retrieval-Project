a modification of warshalls algorithm for
the transitive closure of binary relations

an algorithm is given for computing the transitive
closure of a binary relation that is represented 
by a boolean matrix the algorithm is similar to warshalls
although it executes faster for sparse matrices
on most computers particularly in a paging environment
