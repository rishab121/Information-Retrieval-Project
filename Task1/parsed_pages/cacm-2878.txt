joining policies in a multipriority multiclass batch computer system

consider a multipriority batch computer system
which users from several different classes may 
join its toll service and waiting charges  such a
system is formulated here as a semi-markov decision 
process in which the aim of arriving users is to minimize
their expected loss  the optimal joining 
policy is one of arriving users who may join the system
at some of its queues is a control limit policy 
with a single control number for any possible queue
and the users class a newly arriving user will 
join a queue that is not filled up to the control number
corresponding to this queue and the users class 
 in this paper control numbers as well as lower and upper
bounds for the control numbers and the capacities 
of the systems queues are derived
