the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and consequently affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system  it is
concluded that while for certain values of system 
parameters there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer model in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue the multiplexor in tandem
with a single exponential server the computer 
 analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately poisson
