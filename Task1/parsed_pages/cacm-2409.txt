an algorithm for the approximate solution
of wiener-hopf integral equations

an explicit approximate solution is given for
an equation  where it is assumed that the classical 
wiener-hopf technique may be applied  it is furthermore
assumed that fourier transforms are known explicitly 
 the approximate solution depends on two positive parameters
