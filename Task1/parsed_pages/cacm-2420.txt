havingpartial ordering inference rules

automatic theorem-provers need to be made much
more efficient  with this in mind slagle has 
shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replaced
by built-in inference rules when using a particular 
theorem-proving algorithm based upon hyper-resolution and
paramodulation  the new rules embody the transitivity 
of partial orderings and the close relationship between
 predicates  a program has been developed using 
a modified version of these rules  this new theorem-prover
has been found to be very powerful for solving 
problems involving partial orderings  this paper presents
a detailed description of the program and 
a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it
