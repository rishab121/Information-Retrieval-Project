an interactive graphic display for region
partitioning by linear programming

using linear programming an interactive graphic
display system has been implemented to solve 
the region design problem of partitioning a region into
n nonoverlapping subregions in such a way that 
their areas are in specified proportions and that the
total cost of servicing them is a minimum  in 
a conversational manner a user can easily obtain different
partitionings by specifying and modifying 
the boundary the service centers locations the area
proportions and the cost functions  examples 
are included
