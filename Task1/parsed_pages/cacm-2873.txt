lg a language for analytic geometry

a conversational programming language for analytic
geometry is described together with some 
aspects of its implementation  the language allows
the flexible definition of geometric objects and 
elements computes their parameters and displays the results
it also provides the capability of specifying 
a geometric figure via a collection of parameters and
displaying various loci corresponding to these 
parameters a third characteristic consists of the possibility
of using this language to design other 
user oriented languages  lg has been specifically designed
for use by nonprogrammers it is easy to 
learn and very close to the natural language used in geometry
