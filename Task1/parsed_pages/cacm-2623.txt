a new technique for compression and storage of data

the widespread tendency toward storage of
large programs and blocks off text has produced a 
need for efficient methods of compressing and storing
data  this paper describes techniques that can 
in most cases decrease storage size by a factor of
from two to four  the techniques involve special 
handling of leading and trailing blanks and the encoding
of other symbols in groups of fixed size as 
unique fixed point numbers  the efficiency of the
system is considered and pertinent statistics are 
given and compared with statistics for other information coding techniques
