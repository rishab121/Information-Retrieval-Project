on compiling algorithms for arithmetic expressions

this paper deals with algorithms concerning arithmetic
expressions used in a fortran iv compiler 
for a hitac-5020 computer having n accumulators  the
algorithms generate an object code which minimizes 
the frequency of storing and recovering the partial results
of the arithmetic expressions in cases where 
there are several accumulators
