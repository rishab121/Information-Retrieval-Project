empirical working set behavior

the working set model for program behavior
has been proposed in recent years as a basis for 
the design of scheduling and paging algorithms  although
the words working set are now commonly encountered 
in the literature dealing with resource allocation there
is a dearth of published data on program measurements 
in the hope that workers in the field might find experimental
evidence upon which to substantiate and 
base theoretical work
