on arithmetic expressions and trees

a description is given of how a tree representing the
evaluation of an arithmetic expression 
can be drawn in such a way that the number of accumulators
needed for the computation can be represented 
in a straightforward manner  this representation reduces
the choice of the best order of computation 
to a specific problem under the theory of graphs
 an algorithm to solve this problem is presented
