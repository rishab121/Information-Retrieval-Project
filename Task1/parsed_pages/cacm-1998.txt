complex matrix inversion versus real

a comparison of complex matrix with real matrix inversion
is made  it is shown that the complex inversion can be up to 
twice as fast as the real inversion  further the rounding error
bound for complex inversion is about one-eighth that of real
for gaussian elimination  using extended inner product
accumulation the bound is half of the real system
