multiprogram scheduling parts 1 and 2  introduction and theory

in order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload
 the scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating
 the construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other  a concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
or any subset of it subject to external constraints
such as precedence urgency etc  the algorithm 
is applicable to a wide class of machines
