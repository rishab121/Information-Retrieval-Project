a heuristic problem solving design system
for equipment or furniture layouts

the designer problem solver dps demonstrates
that the computer can perform simple design 
tasks  in particular it designs furniture and equipment
layouts  this task was chosen because it is 
simple well defined and characteristic of many design
tasks in architecture engineering urban planning 
and natural resource management  these space planning
tasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional 
representations of objects to create feasible or optimal
solutions for problems involving topological 
and metric spatial constraints  the paper describes
extensive tests performed on the program  dps is 
a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixed
to it  it uses the planning process to give 
it a sense of direction diagnostic procedures to locate
difficulties and remedial actions to recover 
from difficulties  it uses a convex polygon representation
to accurately describe the objects and the 
layout  this representation allows topological and
metric constraints to be tested and the design to 
be easily updated  dps has been applied to 50 problems
 while it is slow and limited in scope the 
ideas behind it are general  it demonstrates the need
for selectivity in controlling search and the 
methods used to achieve it task-specific information
planning diagnostic procedures remedial actions 
and selective alternative generators
