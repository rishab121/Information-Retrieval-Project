properties of the working-set model

a programs working set wtt at time t is
the set of distinct pages among the t most recently 
referenced pages  relations between the average working-set size
the missing-page rate and the interreference-interval 
distribution may be derived both from time-average definitions
and from ensemble-average statistical 
definitions an efficient algorithm for estimating these
quantities is given  the relation to lru least 
recently used paging is characterized  the independent-reference
model in which page references are 
statistically independent is used to assess the effects
to interpage dependencies on working-set size 
observations under general assumptions working-set
size is shown to be normally distributed
