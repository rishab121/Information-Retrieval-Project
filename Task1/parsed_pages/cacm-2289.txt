cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems

a cellular array is a two-dimensional checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
or cells where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array  the chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing  in this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems  for example the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic  a major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial  in particular several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree distance and path problems with 
direct applications to wire routing pert chart analysis
and the analysis of many types of networks 
 these algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph  straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps
