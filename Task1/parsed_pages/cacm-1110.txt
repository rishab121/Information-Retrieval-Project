a fourier series method for the numerical solution
of a class of parabolic partial differential 
equations

a fourier series method is described which when
applied to a certain class of parabolic partial 
differential equations reduces the problem to a system
of ordinary differential equations  an application 
is given for which the method shows a considerable advantage
over conventional finite difference methods
