a computer center simulation project

todays computation centers are based on rapidly
changing technologies of hardware and software 
systems  it is difficult therefore to base decisions
on experience in most instances the benefits 
of comparable experience for a given problem situation
are not available  in this paper a mathematical 
model of the lockheed central computer center is formulated
that describes the operation of a computation 
center in terms of information nets decision processes
and control functions  experiments performed 
with this model the results of the experiments
and the application of the results are discussed
