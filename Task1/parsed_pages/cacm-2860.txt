a practitioners guide to addressing algorithms

this paper consolidates a number of popular
rules of thumb which have been suggested for the
design of record addressing algorithms and discusses
the applicability of these rules to large commercial 
databases  guidelines for selecting identifier transformations
overflow techniques loading factors 
bucket sizes and loading order and considered  particular
attention is focused on the reasonableness 
of common heuristics for determining primary or secondary
bucket sizes a mathematical model which explicitly 
considers storage device characteristics and time/space
cost tradeoffs is used to analyze the effect 
of design parameters on overall system costs  a
specific design example is presented and solved
