a proposal to establish a pseudo virtual memory via writable overlays

many computer systems solve executable storage
size problems for large programs by using overlays 
 however it appears that no one overlay scheme contains
a well-balanced combination of the most useful 
capabilities which are found in various existing techniques
 a proposal is presented which utilizes 
several of the best capabilities from existing schemes
and is complemented by several additional features 
eg writable overlays  the writable overlay capability
provides a virtual memory effect although the 
programmer may still be required to design the overlay
configuration  since overlay structuring is a 
complex task several tools including a graphic display
are included in the proposal in order to aid 
the programmer in the design  the content of overlays
is briefly discussed and it is noted that many 
of the details of the final overlay configuration may be decided after the fact
