a procedure for generation of three-dimensional
half-toned computer graphics presentations

a description is given of an algorithm for producing computer generated 
half-tone presentations of three-dimensional polygonal surface structures  
this algorithm achieves a significant increase in speed of computation over 
the warnock algorithm developed at the university of utah and implemented
also on the coordinated science laboratory cdc 1604 computer
system at the university of illinois  the history leading to the algorithm
development and then the algorithm itself are described
results are presented and are compared with computer runs achieved
by the warnock approach  an extension of the procedure to variable position
illumination sources is also given
