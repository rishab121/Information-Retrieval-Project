an algorithm for the blocks and cutnodes of a graph

an efficient method is presented for finding
blocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected 
graph  the graph may be represented either i as an
ordered list of edges or ii as a packed adjacency 
matrix  if w denotes the word length of the machine
employed the storage in machine words required 
for a graph with n nodes and m edges increases essentially
as 2m+n in case i or n^2/win case 
ii  a spanning tree with labeled edges is grown
two edges finally bearing different labels if and 
only if they belong to different blocks  for both representations
the time required to analyze a graph 
on n nodes increases as n^g where g depends on the type
of graph 1  g  2 and both bounds are attained 
 values of g are derived for each of several suitable
families of test graphs generated by an extension 
of the web grammar approach  the algorithm is compared
in detail with that proposed by read for which
