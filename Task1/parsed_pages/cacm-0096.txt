on computing radiation integrals

the relative merit and cost of four ways of
evaluating typical radiation integrals containing 
spherical bessel functions are investigated  these methods
are desk machine evaluation of a finite series 
integration of the appropriate differential equation
by a reeves electronic analog computer and by a 
litton 40 ibm 704 computer  results are generally applicable
to equations separated from a helmholtz 
or wave equation
