the design implementation and evaluation of a working set dispatcher

the behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them
 recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed  two implementations
along these principles have been reported but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced  this report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system
