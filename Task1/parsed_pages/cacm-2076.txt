cubic splines on uniform meshes

a very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines
periodic or nonperiodic on uniform meshes  arcs of two cubics suffice
to construct a basis of cardinal splines  an algorithm is given which 
requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off 
of one against the other
