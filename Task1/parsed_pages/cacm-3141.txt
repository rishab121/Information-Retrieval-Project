an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-finding
in circular configurations of processes

this note presents an improvement to lelanns
algorithm for finding the largest or smallest of a set of uniquely
numbered processes arranged in a circle in which no central
controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori
this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective
message extinction in order to achieve an average number of
message passes of order n log n rather than on2
