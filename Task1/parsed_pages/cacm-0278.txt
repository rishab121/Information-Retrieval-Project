a general formulation of storage allocation

formalization of a general computer storage
allocation process is attempted  with a given 
computer m is associated a fictitious computer m essentially
identical to m except in respect to possession 
of unbounded primary storage  mappings of the total
storage set internal and external of m into the 
direct address set of m are introduced  a program
sequence p for m is termed m-admissible relative 
to a specific execution time period if there is a mapping
underwhich p and its effective data referents 
are all located in the direct address set of m  storage
allocation is considered as a process of establishing 
for an arbitrary m program  a sequence of mappings a decoupling
of the program into m-admissible subprograms 
and a linking set of interludes  an existence proof
in terms of a completely interpretive m program 
as indicated  some special cases are discussed  various
restrictions on generality of m programs are 
considered under which more practical realization
of allocation processes becomes tractable
