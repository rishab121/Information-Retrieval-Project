models for parallel processing within programs
application to cpui/o and i/oi/o overlap

approximate queueing models for internal parallel
processing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed 
system are developed in this paper  the solution technique
is developed by network decomposition  the 
models are formulated in terms of cpui/o and i/oi/o overlap
and applied to the analysis of these problems 
 the percentage performance improvement from cpui/o
overlap is found to be greatest for systems which 
are in approximate cpui/o utilization balance and for
low degrees of multiprogramming  the percentage 
improvement from i/oi/o overlap is found to be greatest
for systemtems in which the i/o system is more 
utilized than the cpu
