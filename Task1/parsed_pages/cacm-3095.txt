a selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees

the problem of selecting data items from
a binary search tree according to a list of range 
conditions is considered  the process of visiting a
minimal number of nodes to retrieve data satisfying 
the range conditions is called selective traversal  presented
in this paper is an algorithm for selective 
traversal which uses a tag field for each node in the
tree  the algorithm is particularly useful and 
efficient when examination of data is more time
consuming than examination of a tag field
