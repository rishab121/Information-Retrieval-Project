generating english discourse from semantic networks

a system is described for generating english
sentences from a form of semantic nets in which 
the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths are
primarily deep case relations  the grammar used 
by the system is in the form of a network that imposes
an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations 
that are expressed as lisp functions  the generation
algorithm uses the information in the semantic 
network to select appropriate generation paths through
the grammar  the system is designed for use as 
a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop
and study methods for generating surface strings 
from an underlying semantic structure  initial finding
with regard to form determiners such as voice 
form tense and mood some rules for embedding sentences
and some attention to pronominal substitution 
are reported  the system is programmed in lisp
1.5 and is available from the authors
