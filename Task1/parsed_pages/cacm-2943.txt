lucid a nonprocedural language with iteration

lucid is a formal system in which programs
can be written and proofs of programs carried out 
 the proofs are particularly easy to follow and straightforward
to produce because the statements in 
a lucid program are simply axioms from which the proof
proceeds by almost conventional logical reasoning 
with the help of a few axioms and rules of inference
for the special lucid functions  as a programming 
language lucid is unconventional because among other
things the order of statements is irrelevant 
and assignment statements are equations  nevertheless
lucid programs need not look much different than 
iterative programs in a conventional structured programming
language using assignment and conditional 
statements and loops
