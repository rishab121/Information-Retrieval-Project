a correspondence between algol 60 and churchs lambda-notation part i

this paper describes how some of the semantics
of algol 60 can be formalized by establishing 
a correspondence between expressions of algol 60 and expressions
in a modified form of churchs l-notation 
 first a model for computer languages and compute behavior
is described based on the notions of functional 
application and functional abstraction but also having
analogues for imperative language features  
then this model is used as an abstract object language
into which algol 60 is mapped  many of algol 
60s features emerge as particular arrangements of
a small number of structural rules suggesting new 
classifications and generalizations  the correspondence
is first described informally mainly by illustrations 
 the second part of the paper gives a formal description
ie an abstract compiler into the abstract 
objct language  this is itself presented in a purely
functional notation that is one using only 
application and abstraction
