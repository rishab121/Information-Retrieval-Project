integration the political economy of computing

the impacts of an automated client-tracking
system on the clients caseworkers administrators 
and operations of the welfare agencies that use it are
reported  the major impact of this system was 
to enhance the administrative  attractiveness of the
using agencies in the eyes of funders rather than 
to increase their internal administrative efficiency 
this impact is a joint product of both the technical 
features of the computer-based system and of the organizational
demands placed upon different agencies 
administrators and caseworkers  it illustrates the
way successful automated information systems fit 
the political economies of the groups that use them
