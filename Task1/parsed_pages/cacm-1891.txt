three-dimensional computer display

a stereographic display terminal has been
produced using the raster display brad recently 
developed at brookhaven  the system uses a rotating refresh
memory to feed standard television monitors 
 to produce a stereographic display the computer calculates
the projected video images of an object 
viewed from two separate points  the resulting video
maps are stored on separate refresh bands of the 
rotating memory  the two output signals are connected
to separate color guns of a color television monitor 
thus creating a superimposed image on the screen  optical
separation is achieved by viewing the image 
through color filters  the display is interactive and
can be viewed by a large group of people at the 
same time
