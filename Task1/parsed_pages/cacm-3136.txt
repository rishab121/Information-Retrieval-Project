price/performance patterns of u computer systems

econometric models of the u computer market have been developed to study 
the relationships between system price and hardware performance  single
measures of price/performance such as groschs law are shown to
be so over simplified as to be meaningless  multiple-regression models
predicting system cost as a function of several hardware
characteristics do however reveal a market dichotomy  on one hand there
exists a stable price predictable market for larger general
purpose computer systems  the other market is the developing one
for small business computer systems a market which is relatively
unstable with low price predictability
