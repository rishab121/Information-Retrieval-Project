analysis of algorithms for the zero-one programming problem

this paper is concerned with a review and examination
of several existing algorithms for the 
zero-one programming problem  computational experience
is summarized  the machine time and storage 
requirements of several of the algorithms are compared
over several test problems of small and intermediate 
size  computer experiments still provide little hope
of solving problems with over 100 variables with 
a reasonable amount of machine time
