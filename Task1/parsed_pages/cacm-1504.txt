algorithms for finding a fundamental set
of cycles for an undirected linear graph

given the adjacency matrix of the graph the algorithm
presented in this paper finds a spanning 
tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles
 our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented 
by welch by a ratio of n/3 n is the number of nodes
but requires less storage  for graphs with a large 
number of nodes and edges when storage is limited our
algorithm is superior to welchs however when 
the graphs are small or machine storage is very large
welchs algorithm is superior  timing estimates 
and storage requirements for both methods are presented
