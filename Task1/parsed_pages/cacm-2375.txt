a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policies

five well-known scheduling policies for movable
head disks are compared using the performance 
criteria of expected seek time system orientedand expected
waiting time individual i/o request oriented 
 both analytical and simulation results are obtained
 the variance of waiting time is introduced as 
another meaningful measure of performance showing possible
discrimination against individual requests 
 then the choice of a utility function to measure total
performance including system oriented and individual 
request oriented measures is described  such a function
allows one to differentiate among the scheduling 
policies over a wide range of input loading conditions
 the selection and implementation of a maximum 
performance two-policy algorithm are discussed
