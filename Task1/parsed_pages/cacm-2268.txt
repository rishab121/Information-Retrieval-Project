a comparative study of computer programs
for integrating differential equations

a study comparing the performance of several computer
programs for integrating systems of ordinary 
differential equations is reported  the integration methods represented
include multistep methods predictor-correctors 
single-step methods runge-kutta and extrapolation methods
both polynomial and rational  the testing 
procedure is described together with the evaluation
criteria applied  a set of test problems on which 
the programs were tested is included in an appendix
 for the particular problems and criteria used in 
the investigation it was found that a program based on
rational extrapolation showed the best performance
