syntax-directed documentation for pl 360

the language pl 360 together with its phrase structure grammar is used as a 
concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed documentation 
this idea is 1 to use the phrase structure of a program to define the 
structure of a formal documentation for that program 2 to use the syntactic 
types and identifiers in the resulting structure to trigger the automatic
formation of questions to the programmer whose answers will
become part of that documentation and 3 to provide automatic storage
and retrieval facilities so that other programmers who want
to understand or modify the program can access the resulting documentation
which is cross-indexed in various ways by syntactic types
and objects  a small pl 360 program already found
in the literature is worked out as an example
