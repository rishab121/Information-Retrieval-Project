relative effects of central processor and input-output
speeds upon throughput on the large computer

presented in this paper is a technique for
determining the relative effects of the internal 
speed of the computer and the speed of the input-output
units upon the overall speed of the system equations 
are derived which permit the determination of these
effects from hardware usage measurements
