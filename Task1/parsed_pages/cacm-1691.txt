a comparison of the correlational behavior
of random number generators for the ibm 360

hutchinson states that the new prime modulo
multiplicative congruential pseudorandom generator 
attributed to d h lehmer has passed the usual statistical
tests for random number generators  it 
is here empirically shown that generators of this type
can produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions 
up to lag 50 exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for many
multiplicative constants  an alternative generator 
proposed by tausworthe which uses irreducible polynomials
over the field of characteristic two is shown 
to be free from this defect  the applicability of these
two generators to the ibm 360 is then discussed 
 since computer word size can affect a generators statistical
behavior the older mixed and simple congruential 
generators although extensively tested on computers
having 36 or more bits per word may not be optimum
