formal verification of parallel programs

two formal models for parallel computation
are presented an abstract conceptual model and 
a parallel-program model  the former model does not
distinguish between control and data states  the 
latter model includes the capability for the representation
of an infinite set of control states by allowing 
there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers or
processes executing the program  an induction 
principle is presented which treats the control and
data state sets on the same ground  through the 
use of place variables it is observed that certain
correctness conditions can be expressed without 
enumeration of the set of all possible control states
 examples are presented in which the induction 
principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion
 it is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle
a special case of the assertions method which 
is called parallel place assertions is shown to be
incomplete  a formalization of deadlock is then 
presented the concept of a norm is introduced which
yields an extension to the deadlock problem 
of floyds technique for proving termination  also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
and permits shared global variables  correctness 
of certain forms of implementation is also discussed
 an appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas
