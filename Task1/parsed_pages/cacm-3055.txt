an analysis of algorithms for the dutch national flag problem

solutions to the dutch national flag problem
have been given by dijkstra 1 and meyer 3 
 dijkstra starts with a simple program and arrives at
an improved program by refinement  both of the 
algorithms given by dijkstra are shown to have an expected number
of swaps which is 2/3n + 01 and that 
these values differ at most by 1/3 of a swap and asymptotically
by 1/4 of a swap  the algorithm of meyer 
is shown to have expected swap complexity 5/9n
