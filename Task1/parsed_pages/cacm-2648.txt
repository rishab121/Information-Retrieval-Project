a design for a number theory package
with an optimized trial division routine

a number theory package is described which uses
doubly linked list structures for storing multiprecise 
integers  the package has been coded in ibms basic
assembly language and makes heavy use of the macro 
language and conditional assembly  an optimally coded
trial division routine is also described which 
can be used to determine the unique factorization of large integers
