multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching

this paper develops the multidimensional binary
search tree or k-d tree where k is the dimensionality 
of the search space as a data structure for storage of
information to be retrieved by associative searches 
the k-d tree is defined and examples are given it
is shown to be quite in its storage requirements 
 a significant advantage of this structure is that a single
data structure can handle many types of queries 
very efficiently  various utility algorithms are developed
their proven average running times in an 
n record file are insertion o log n deletion of
the root o n^k-1/k deletion of a random node 
o log n and optimization guarantees logarithmic performance
of searches o n log n  search algorithms 
are given for partial match queries with t keys specified
proven maximum running time of o n^k-t/k 
and for nearest neighbor queries empirically observed average
running time of o log n  these performances 
far surpass the best currently known algorithms for
these tasks  an algorithm is presented to handle 
any general intersection query the main focus of this
paper theoretical  it is felt however that 
k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications
and examples of potential uses are given
