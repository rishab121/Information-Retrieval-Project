computer construction of project networks

project networks are used in pert and cpm
 an algorithm is given for constructing project 
networks directly from the project precedence relations
 the algorithm creates dummy activities and 
topologically orders the arcs and nodes  the number of
nodes created is minimal for the given precedence 
relations  it has been experimentally programmed
in fortran ii for the ibm 7094
