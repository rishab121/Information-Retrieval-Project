code structures for protection and manipulation of variable-length items

when items are made up of a variable number
of characters each containing the same number 
of bits certain control information partition symbols
is inserted to mark their separations  since 
errors in identification of these control characters
can lead to serious trouble methods of protecting 
these symbols are indicated  a 6-bit code assignment
of alphanumeric characters for fixed word-length 
computers is given and its suitability for error detection
and variable-length item manipulation is shown 
 also indicated is its flexibility during certain arithmetic operations
