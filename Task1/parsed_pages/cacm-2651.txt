the treatment of data types in el1

in constructing a general purpose programming
language a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation  the el1 language contains
a number of features specifically designed to 
simultaneously satisfy both requirements  the resulting
treatment of data types includes provision for 
programmer-defined data types data types and generic
routines programmer control over type conversion 
and very flexible data type behavior in a context that
allows efficient compiled code and compact data 
representation
