permutation of data blocks in a bubble memory

a common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of minor 
loops connected through another major loop  the problem of obtaining any 
give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied
in this paper  a lower bound to the number of steps required buy
a permutation algorithm is derived and the class of optimum algorithms is 
identified
