coding the lehmer pseudo-random number generator

an algorithm and coding technique is presented
for quick evaluation of the lehmer pseudo-random 
number generator modulo 231  1 a prime mersenne
number with produces 231  2 numbers on a p-bit 
greater than 31 computer  the computation method is
extendible to limited problems in modular arithmetic 
 prime factorization for 261  2 and a primitive root
for 261  1 the next largest prime mersenne 
number are given for possible construction of a pseudo-random
number generator of increased cycle length
