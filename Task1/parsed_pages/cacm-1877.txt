prevention of system deadlocks

a well-known problem in the design of operating
systems is the selection of a resource allocation 
policy that will prevent deadlock  deadlock is the
situation in which resources have been allocated 
to various tasks in such a way that none of the tasks
can continue  the various published solutions 
have been somewhat restrictive either they do not handle
the problem in sufficient generality or they 
suggest policies which will on occasion refuse a request
which could have been safely granted  algorithms 
are presented which examine a request in the light of
the current allocation of resources and determine 
whether or not the granting of the request will introduce
the possibility of a deadlock  proofs given 
in the appendixes show that the conditions imposed by
the algorithms are both necessary and sufficient 
to prevent deadlock  the algorithms have been successfully used in the the system
