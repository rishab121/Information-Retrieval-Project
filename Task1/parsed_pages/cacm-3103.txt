automatic data structure selection an example and overview

the use of several levels of abstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs  when programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details  in the past 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type 
 thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time  in this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed  this process is discussed in detail for
an example program  general issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed
