interpolation search -a log logn search

interpolation search is a method of retrieving
a desired record by key in an ordered file by 
using the value of the key and the statistical distribution
of the keys  it is shown that on the average 
log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key
assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed 
 the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shown
to be very low  the same holds if the cumulative 
distribution function of the keys is known  computational
experiments confirm these results
