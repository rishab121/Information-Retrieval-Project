the development of decision tables via
parsing of complex decision situations

a new parsing technique is proposed which allows
parsing based only on syntactical characteristics 
of the decision problem  it requires a description
of the problem in decision grid chart format and 
allows the development of decision tables within defined
limits by avoiding or at least minimizing 
repetition of conditions and actions in the resulting tables
