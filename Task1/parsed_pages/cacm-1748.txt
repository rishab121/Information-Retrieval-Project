a scheduling philosophy for multiprocessing systems

a collection of basic ideas is presented which
have been evolved by various workers over the 
past four years to provide a suitable framework for the
design and analysis of multiprocessing systems 
 the notions of process and state vector are discussed
and the nature of basic operations on processes 
is considered  some of the connections between processes
and protection are analyzed  a very general 
approach to priority-oriented scheduling is described
and its relationship to conventional interrupt 
systems is explained  some aspects of time-oriented
scheduling are considered the implementation of 
the scheduling mechanism is analyzed in detail and the
feasibility of embodying it in hardware established 
 finally several methods for interlocking the execution
of independent processes are presented and compared
