automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
microsentenceshas often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages  to explore the prospects of such
a step the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program  the basic
idea was to extract the subject verb and object 
if any of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence  a program 
is described in this paper which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems they may have practical
value in man-machine systems using human monitors 
to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence
