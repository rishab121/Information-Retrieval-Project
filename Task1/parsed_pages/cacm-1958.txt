improving round-off in runge-kutta computations with gills method

a runge-kutta-gill scheme in common use is based on an incomplete
adaptation for floating point operations of gills method  an
improved version reduces round-off error significantly  in this note
the heart of the scheme is presented in fortran language  it is
then shown how an improved version of the method can be obtained with
the addition of two fortran statements  the two version is a
significant improvement  a numerical example comparing the two is included
