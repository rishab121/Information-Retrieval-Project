mathematics for undergraduate computer scientists

the mathematical requirements for an undergraduate
program in computer science are a subject 
of debate  the association for computing machinerys
curriculum committee however believes that these 
requirements are essentially the same as the mathematical
content of physical sciences undergraduate 
programs  the committee believes that these requirements
should assure the student of a broad mathematical 
background and should enable him to take a wide variety
of courses in other scientific disciplines  
the committees concern is to develop a solid
scientific  approach to computer science
