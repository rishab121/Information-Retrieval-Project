optimal shift strategy for a block-transfer ccd memory

for the purposes of this paper a block-transfer
ccd memory is composed of serial shift registers 
whose shift rate can vary but which have a definite minimum
shift rate the refresh rate and a definite 
maximum shift rate  the bits iin the shift registers
are numbered 0 to n  1 and blocks of n bits are 
always transferred always starting at bit 0   what
is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer 
request occurring at a random time will have to wait the
minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached 
 the minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one
to  simply park at bit 0 and wait for a transfer 
request  the optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly
as possible until bit 0 is passed then shifting 
as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is
reached shortly before bit 0 comes around again 
 this is called the hurry up and wait strategy and is well
known outside the computer field  the block-transfer 
ccd memory can also be viewed as a paging drum
with a variable bounded rotation speed
