the laconiq monitor time sharing for online dialogues

the laconiq laboratory computer online inquiry
monitor was developed primarily to support 
non-numerical applications such as retrieval from very
large files by means of a dialogue between a 
system user and a retrieval application  the monitor
was designed so that it could work with a small 
computer an ibm system 360/30  therefore techniques
for resource allocation were important  for this 
reason the use of core storage computational facilities
and input-output were all scheduled  an unusual 
feature of the system is that it is event-driven rather
than clock-driven  the program segments called 
into execution by the remote crt consoles are invariably
run to completion rather than rolled-out to 
be brought back at a later time
