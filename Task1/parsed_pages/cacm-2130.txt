automatic segmentation of cyclic program structures
based on connectivity and processor timing

time-shared multiprogrammed and overlayed batch systems frequently
require segmentation of computer programs into discrete portions  
these program portions are transferred between executable and
peripheral storage whenever necessary segmentation of program
s in a manner that  reduces the frequency of such transfers is the
subject of this paper  segmentation techniques proposed by c v
ramamoorthy are subject to limitations that arise when the preferred
segment size is not compatible with the physical restrictions
imposed by the available computing equipment  a generalization of
ramamoorthys suggestions is made in order to allow their application 
when circumstances are other than ideal
