on the distributions of significant digits and roundoff errors

generalized logarithmic law is derived for
the distribution of the first t significant digits 
of a random digital integer  this result is then used
to determine the distribution of the roundoff 
errors in floating-point operations which is a mixture
of uniform and reciprocal distributions
