common phrases and minimum-space text storage

a method for saving storage space for text
strings such as compiler diagnostic messages is 
described  the method relies on hand selection of a
set of text strings which are common to one or more 
messages  these phrases are then stored only once 
the storage technique gives rise to a mathematical 
optimization problem determine how each message should
use the available phrases to minimize its storage 
requirement  this problem is nontrivial when phrases
which overlap exist  however a dynamic programming 
algorithm is presented which solves the problem in time
which grows linearly with the number of characters 
in the text  algorithm 444 applies to this paper
