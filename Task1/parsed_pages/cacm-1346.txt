on the application of the process of equalization
of maxima to obtain rational approximation 
to certain modified bessel functions

the second remes algorithm as originally established
for polynomials may converge or not when 
the approximating functions are rational  however the
few results known in this domain show how efficient 
the algorithm can be to obtain approximations with a
small error much more than in the polynomial case 
in which the best approximation can be very nearly
approached directly by a series development  the 
aim of this paper is to investigate the limitations
of the applicability of certain extensions of the 
algorithm to the case where the approximations are rational
as well as to present some numerical results
