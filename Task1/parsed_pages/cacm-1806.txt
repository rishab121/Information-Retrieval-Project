on the downhill method

the downhill method is a numerical method for
solving complex equations fz  0 on which the 
only restriction is that the function w  fz must
be analytical  an introduction to this method is 
given and a critical review of relating literature is
presented  although in theory the method always 
converges it is shown that a fundamental dilemma exists
which may cause a breakdown in practical applications 
 to avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate of
convergence toward a root some modifications of 
the original method are proposed and a program fortran
based on the modified method is given in algorithm 
365  some numerical examples are included
