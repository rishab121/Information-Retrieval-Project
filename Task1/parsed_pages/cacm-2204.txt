program development by stepwise refinement

the creative activity of programming-to be distinguished
from coding-is usually taught by examples 
serving to exhibit certain techniques  it is here considered
as a sequence of design decisions concerning 
the decomposition of tasks into subtasks and of data
into data structures  the process of successive 
refinement of specifications is illustrated by a short
but nontrivial example from which a number of 
conclusions are drawn regarding the art and the instruction of programming
