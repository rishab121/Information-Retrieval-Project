generating prime implicants via ternary encoding and decimal arithmetic

decimal arithmetic ternary encoding of cubes
and topological considerations are used in an 
algorithm to obtain the extremals and prime implicants
of boolean functions the algorithm which has 
been programmed in the fortran language generally requires
less memory than other minimization procedures 
and treats dont care terms in an efficient manner
