some ideas on data types in high-level languages

a number of issues are explored concerning the
notion that a data type is a set of values together 
with a set of primitive operations on those values  among
these are the need for a notation for iterating 
over the elements of any finite set instead of the
more narrow for i 1 to n notation the use of 
the domain of an array as a data type the need for
a simple notation for allowing types of parameters 
to be themselves parameters but in a restrictive fashion
and resulting problems with conversion of 
values from one type to another
