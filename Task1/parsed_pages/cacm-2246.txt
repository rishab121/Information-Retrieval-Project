levels of language for portable software

an increasing amount of software is being
implemented in a portable form  a popular way of 
accomplishing this is to encode the software in a specially
designed machine-independent language and 
then to map this language often using a macro processor
into the assembly language of each desired 
object machine  the design of the machine-independent
language is the key factor in this operation 
 this paper discusses the relative merits of pitching
this language at a high level or a low level and 
presents some comparative results
