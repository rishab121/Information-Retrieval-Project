generalized working sets for segment reference strings

the working-set concept is extended for programs
that reference segments of different sizes 
 the generalized working-set policy gws keeps as its
resident set those segments whose retention costs 
do not exceed their retrieval costs  the gws is a model
for the entire class of demand-fetching memory 
policies that satisfy a resident-set inclusion property
 a generalized optimal policy gopt is also 
defined at its operating points it minimizes aggregated
retention and swapping costs  special cases 
of the cost structure allow gws and gopt to simulate
any known stack algorithm the working set and 
vmin  efficient procedures for computing demand curves
showing swapping load as a function of memory 
usage are developed for gws and gopt policies  empirical
data from an actual system are included
