sorting on a mesh-connected parallel computer

two algorithms are presented for sorting n^2
elements on an n x n mesh-connected processor 
array that require on routing and comparison steps
 the best previous algorithm takes time on log 
n  the algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimal
in time within small constant factors  extensions 
to higher-dimensional arrays are also given
