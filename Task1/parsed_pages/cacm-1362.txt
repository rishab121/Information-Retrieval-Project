code extension in ascii an asa tutorial

the american standard code for information
interchange ascii contains a number of control 
characters associated with the principle of code extension
that is with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the code  the manner of use of these 
characters has not previously been completely described
 this paper presents a set of mutually consistent 
philosophies regarding code extension applications
and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the 
application of the code extension characters  distinctions
are drawn between code extension and such 
other concepts as graphic substitution or syntactic
representation which are often used to meet similar 
requirements  also covered are certain topics which
are not truly concerned with code extension but 
which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications
 the material in this paper is equally 
applicable in principle to the proposed iso international
7-bit code for information interchange
