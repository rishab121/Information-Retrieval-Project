symbolic integration the stormy decade

three approaches to symbolic integration in the
1960s are described  the first from artificial 
intelligence led to slagles saint and to a large
degree to moses sin  the second from algebraic 
manipulation led to manoves implementation and to
horowitz and tobeys reexamination of the hermite 
algorithm for integrating rational functions  the third
from mathematics led to richardsons proof 
of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functions
and for rischs decision procedure for the 
elementary functionseneralizations of rischs algorithm
to a class of special functions and programs 
for solving differential equations and for finding
the definite integral are also described
