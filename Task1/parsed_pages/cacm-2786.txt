a system for typesetting mathematics

this paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics 
 the language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people for example secretaries and 
mathematical typists who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting  experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions  for typical expressions 
the size and font changes positioning line drawing and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically  for example
the input sum from io to infinity x sub ipi over 
2 produces formula  the syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands  output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions  the system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply  this paper was typeset by the authors using the system described
