a hardware implementation on the maniac ii computer
of the working set model for demand paging 
as introduced by denning is discussed  characteristics
of the maniac ii are given along with a description 
of the basic demand paging scheme and the associate memory
which has been added to the maniac ii hardware 
 finally a description of the hardware design for implementation
of the working set model is discussed 
and a specification of the actions taken under various
