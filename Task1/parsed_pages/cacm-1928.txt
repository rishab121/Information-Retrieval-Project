exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks

a technique for simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active digital systems 
is described  essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation economy 
in execution time and space and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities  the main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities  the passage of
time is simulated in a precise quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous
and asynchronous logic  certain aspects 
of the techniques described may be used for the simulation
of network structures other than digital networks
