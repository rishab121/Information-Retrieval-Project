near-minimax polynomial approximations and partitioning of intervals

a method of near-minimax polynomial approximation
is described  as a by-product this method 
provides a formula for an estimate of the maximum error
associated with a given degree of approximation 
 using this formula a partitioning algorithm is obtained
for dividing a basic interval into subintervals 
for which approximations of equal degree give equal maximum error
