an efficient composite formula for multidimensional quadrature

a 2s+1-point second-degree quadrature formula
for integration over an s-dimensional hyper-rectangle 
is presented  all but one of the points lie on the
surface with weights of opposite sign attached to 
points on opposite faces  when a large volume is subdivided
into congruent rectangular subdivisions 
only one point is required in each interior subdivision
to achieve second-degree accuracy
