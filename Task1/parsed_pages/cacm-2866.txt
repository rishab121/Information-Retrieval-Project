proving monitors

interesting scheduling and sequential properties
of monitors can be proved by using state variables 
which record the monitors history and by defining extended
proof rules for their wait and signal operations 
 these two techniques are defined discussed and applied
to examples to prove properties such as freedom 
from indefinitely repeated overtaking or unnecessary waiting
upper bounds on queue lengths and historical 
behavior
