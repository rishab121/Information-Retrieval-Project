convex hulls of finite sets of poin ts in two and three dimensions

the convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in two
and three dimensions can be determined with on 
log n operations  the presented algorithms use the divide
and conquer technique and recursively apply 
a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls
 since any convex hull algorithm requires at 
least on log n operations the time complexity of the
proposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative 
constant
