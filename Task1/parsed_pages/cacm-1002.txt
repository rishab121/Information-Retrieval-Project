a rapid method for digital filtering

since much of the computer time spent in time-series
analysis is used for multiplications 
a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital
filtering with the expectation that it would 
be useful in the on line real-time analysis of biological
data  the filters are constructed from a succession 
of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitates
cascading  the repertoire of frequency 
response curves includes relatively good low-pass and
band-pass designs  programs are available for 
implementing both the synthesis of these filters and
their application on computers whose assemblers 
allow the definition of recursive macros
