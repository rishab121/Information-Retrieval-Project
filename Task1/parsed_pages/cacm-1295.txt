pert time calculations without topological ordering

a simplified technique is presented for pert
time calculations without topological ordering 
 each event is assigned a unique memory location  an activity
is represented by a link  a link is defined 
as a memory location containing the address of another
memory location  the time information for an 
activity is carried with its link  for a typical net
the majority of activities can be described by 
one 36-bit cell each  the remainder use two 36-bit
cells each  the links are unidirectional forward 
during the te calculation expected completion time for
an activitybackward during the tl calculation 
time latest allowable for completion of an activity 
the calculations progress through the net topologically 
even though the net is not represented topologically in core
