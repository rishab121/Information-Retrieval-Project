considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
but not executable fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600s that share one
million words of extended core storage  in the 
generalization of such a design special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional slower
speed random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory
