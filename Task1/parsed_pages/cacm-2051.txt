a pl/i program to assist the comparative linguist

a practical pl/i program is described which
can assist comparative linguists to determine
the regular sound correspondences between genetically related languages
the investigator must arrange data for input by aligning pairs
of suspected cognates  the program tabulates the correspondences
and uses list processing techniques to sort and count them
each pair of words is then assigned a relative value that is a function
of the total frequency in the data of each correspondence found
in that pair of words  the output is a list of all correspondence
types with their frequency of occurrence in the data and a
separate listing of each correspondence with all word-pairs showing
that correspondence unless their relative value is below an arbitrarily 
chosen cutoff point  the article explains the usefulness
as well as the limitations of the programs and illustrates its
use with a small portion of hypothetical data
