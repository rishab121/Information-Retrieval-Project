mechanical program analysis

one means of analyzing program performance
is by deriving closed-form expressions for their 
execution behavior  this paper discusses the mechanization
of such analysis and describes a system 
metric which is able to analyze simple lisp programs
and produce for example closed-form expressions
for their running time expressed in terms of size of input
 this paper presents the reasons for mechanizing 
program analysis describes the operation of metric explains
its implementation and discusses its limitations
