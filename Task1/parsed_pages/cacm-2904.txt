an algorithm for reduction of operator strength

a simple algorithm which uses an indexed temporary
table to perform reduction of operator strength 
in strongly connected regions is presented  several extensions
including linear function test replacement 
are discussed  these algorithms should fit well into an
integrated package of local optimization algorithms
