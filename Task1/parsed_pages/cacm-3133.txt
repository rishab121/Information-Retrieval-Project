logic and semantic networks

an extended form of semantic network is defined which can
be regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic
by virtue of its relationship with logic the extended
semantic network is provided with a precise semantics
inference rules and a procedural interpretation  on
the other hand by regarding semantic networks as an 
abstract data structure for the representation of clauses we provide a
theorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-following
strategy for guiding the search for a proof
