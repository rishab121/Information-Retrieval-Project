a programming system for the on-line analysis of biomedical images

a preliminary description of the software for a computer-display
system is given with special emphasis on the  man-machine interaction this 
system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications
as an example the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes  the 
system is separated into four programming tasks picture transformations file 
maintenance picture structuring and display management  picture structuring
is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication
a prototype data format for pictures called a picture-form is developed
structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce 
new pictures-forms  many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical 
laboratory at mit conceived by marvin minsky
