a variation of the goodman-lance method for
the solution of two-point boundary value problems

a recently published method for the interpolative
solution of nonlinear equations is improved
and applied to give a significant variation of the goodman-lance
method for the solution of two-point boundary value problems 
the resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution
of optimal control problems in the euler-lagrange formulation
quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation
is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context
