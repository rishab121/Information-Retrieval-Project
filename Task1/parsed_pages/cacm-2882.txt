a stochastic evaluation model for database
organization in data retrieval systems

experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost this paper
discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval 
system which has the effect of significantly reducing
the cost of experimentation and enabling research 
never attempted before  the model is designed to estimate
the retrieval workload of alternative data 
retrieval systems  these data retrieval systems can
be organized under several database organizations 
including inverted list threaded list and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems  effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems  in particular
the impact of query complexity is analyzed
