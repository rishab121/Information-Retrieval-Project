on computing sets of shortest paths in a graph

two algorithms are presented that construct
the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices 
in a directed graph  these algorithms generalize the floyd
algorithm and the dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph
