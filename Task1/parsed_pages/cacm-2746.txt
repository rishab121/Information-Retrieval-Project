efficient string matching an aid to bibliographic search

this paper describes a simple efficient algorithm
to locate all occurrences of any of a finite 
number of keywords in a string of text  the algorithm
consists of constructing a finite state pattern 
matching machine from the keywords and then using the
pattern matching machine to process the text string 
in a single pass  construction of the pattern matching
machine takes time proportional to the sum of 
the lengths of the keywords  the number of state transitions
made by the pattern matching machine in 
processing the text string is independent of the number
of keywords  the algorithm has been used to 
improve the speed of a library bibliographic
search program by a factor of 5 to 10
