algorithm  logic + control

an algorithm can be regarded as consisting of a logic component
which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems
and a control component which determines the problem-solving
strategies by means of which that knowledge is used  the logic component
determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control
component only affects its efficiency  the efficiency of an
algorithm can often by improving the control component without changing
the logic of the algorithm  we argue that computer programs would
be more often correct and more easily improved and modified if
their logic and control aspects were identified and separated in
the program text
