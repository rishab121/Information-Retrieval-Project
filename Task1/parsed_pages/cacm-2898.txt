a conceptual framework for a nonprocedural programming language

a sequential programming language forces the
programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in 
which the operations in his program have to be executed
even if the order is not relevant to the solution 
of his problem  the requirement to indicate irrelevant
sequencing can be removed if the language provides 
facilities for specifying a task in a nonprocedural
manner  in general a program specified in this 
way will allow concurrent evaluation  this paper describes
a conceptual framework for a high level programming 
language providing both nonprocedural and sequential
facilities  within a program nonprocedural and 
sequential program modules may be nested freely
