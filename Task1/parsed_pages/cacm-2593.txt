a back-end computer for data base management

it is proposed that the data base management
function be placed on a dedicated back-end computer 
which accepts commands in a relatively high level language
such as the codasyl data base task group 
april 1971 report from a host computer accesses the
data base on secondary storage and returns results 
 the advantages of such a configuration are discussed  an
experimental implementation called the experimental 
data management system xdms is described and certain
conclusions about the back-end approach are drawn 
from this implementation
