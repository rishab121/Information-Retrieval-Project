fast finite-difference solution of biharmonic problems

setting the reynolds number equal to zero in
a method for solving the navier-strokes equations 
numerically results in a fast numerical method for
biharmonic problems  the equation is treated as 
a system of two second order equations and a simple
smoothing process is essential for convergence  
an application is made to a crack-type problem
