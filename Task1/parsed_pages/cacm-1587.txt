storage allocation in a certain iterative process

a method of core storage allocation in a certain
iterative process is described and estimates 
of the machine time required are given  the method is
applicable to iterative processes in which input 
data items once chosen are never again needed  in this
method the input data is continuously relocated 
and the space made available apportioned to the output
tables when an overflow occurs  some important 
special cases are considered in which considerable simplification occurs
