the description list of concepts

a concept is defined as a class of objects
whose members can be distinguished by processing 
its properties  property is defined to mean a partition
of the set of all objects into disjoint classes 
 the formal definition of a concept is recursive in nature
 a concept is described by a list structure 
 a one-to-one correspondence is established between the
recursive definition of a concept and its description 
list structure  like the definition the description
list structure of a concept is also built up from 
elementary list structures by a recursive process 
the list structures obtained this way are compared 
with the description list structure discussed
by the author in a previous publication
