shift-register code for indexing applications

in this communication the use of a shift-register
code with n  10 is described for calling 
64 wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order
 a high degree of redundancy is used permitting 
a single-error correcting code minimum-distance-three
code with 64 10-bit code words to be employed 
as the station identification code  embedding this in
the shift-register code with period 1023 permits 
the code to be employed without punctuation each of
the telemetering station receivers simply putting 
received ones and zeros into a shift register  each
time the given code combination arises identifying 
the particular station barring for tuitous error combinations
of very low probability it has been called 
 the communication describes the properties and application
of the code in some detail and the finding 
of the particular example to be employed on ural the
soviet-built drum computer donated to the indian 
statistical institute by the united nations
