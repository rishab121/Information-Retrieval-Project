divide-and-correct methods for multiple precision division

a division problem is defined and notation
to relate it to the problem of multiple precision 
operation in a digital computer is introduced  a basic
divide-and-correct method for multiple precision 
division is formulated and its known properties briefly
reviewed  of particular interest is the fact 
that the method produces at each step a set of precisely
three estimates for the desired result one 
of which is exact
