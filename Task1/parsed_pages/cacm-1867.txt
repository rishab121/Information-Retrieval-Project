on the expected lengths of sequences generated
in sorting by replacement selecting

in the replacement-selecting technique of sorting
one is interested in the ratio lj of the 
expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the
technique to the number of memory cells used  
using complex-variable theory it is shown that lj
 2 and that asymptotically the average interval 
between sign changes of lj-2 is 2.6662
