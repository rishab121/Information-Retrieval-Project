a unifying approach to scheduling

this paper presents a scheme for classifying
scheduling algorithms based on an abstract model 
of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion of
priority  various classes of scheduling algorithms
are defined and related to existing algorithms  a
criterion for the implementation efficiency of an 
algorithm is developed and results in the definition
of time-invariant algorithms which include most 
of the commonly implemented ones  for time-invariant
algorithms the dependence of processing rates 
on priorities is derived  the abstract model provides
a framework for implementing flexible schedulers 
in real operating systems  the policy-driven scheduler
of bernstein and sharp is discussed as an example 
of such an implementation
