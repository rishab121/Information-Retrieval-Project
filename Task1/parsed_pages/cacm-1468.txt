syntax-directed interpretation of classes of pictures

a descriptive scheme for classes of pictures based
on labeling techniques using parallel processing 
algorithms was proposed by the author some years ago
 since then much work has been done in applying 
this to bubble chamber pictures  the parallel processing
simulator originally written for an ibm 7094
system has now been rewritten for a cdc 3600 system
 this paper descriptive models by considering their 
specific application to bubble chamber pictures  how
the description generated in this phase can be 
embedded in a larger conversation program is explained
by means of a certain specific example that 
has been worked out  a partial generative grammar for
handwritten english letters is given as are 
also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammar
and the parallel processing simulator mentioned 
earlier
