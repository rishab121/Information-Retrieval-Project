this paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing  an 80-column ibm card is divided into two
fields-reference material field columns 1-67 
and identification field columns 68-80  the format
for the reference material is flexible while the 
format for the identification is rigid  the reference
material includes basically an index title source 
class summary and cross reference for each entry 
the identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors an entry number and the kind
major interest and source of the reference  the 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files  since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books articles programming terms hardware terms equipment
machine systems abbreviations etc it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing
