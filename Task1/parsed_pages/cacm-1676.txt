the lrltran compiler

extensive software problems confront an organization
which possesses a number of different 
computers and which frequently acquires new ones 
to maintain cohesion a system must be developed 
written in a high level language which minimizes machine
dependencies and isolates those which are necessary 
 a language and a compiler for the language are discussed
here  the language called lrltran is a heavily 
augmented fortran  the tree-pass compiler makes use
internally of a postfix polish notation pass i 
to pass ii and a tree representation referred to as
a composite blocking table pass i to pass iii 
 machine-independent optimization occurs in pass ii
and do-loop and machine-dependent optimization in 
pass iii
