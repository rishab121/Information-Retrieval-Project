program translation viewed as a general data processing problem

efficiency dictates that the overall effectiveness
of a compiler be increased by all means 
available  for a compiler to have a substantial useful
life it needs a clear logical structure reliability 
and sound data processing techniques  a compiler must
be based on fixed conventions to preserve efficiency 
and reliability empty options and default conventions
violate this dictum  use of structure to associate 
various parts of a program and economy of
features promote clarity and reliability
