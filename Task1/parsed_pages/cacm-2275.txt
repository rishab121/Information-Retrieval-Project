integral equations of immunology

the inversion of a particular integral equation
of the first fredholm kind is the basic problem 
considered  the strategy which yielded success consisted
of three essential points 1 fit the known 
experimental data by a curve with properties which derive
from properties of the as yet unknown function 
2 stabilize the computation for the unknown function
by using singular value decomposition 3 constrain 
the unknown function approximation since it represents
a probability distribution to be nonnegative 
 a number of test cases are presented one set of actual
experimental data is analyzed with the procedures 
presented
