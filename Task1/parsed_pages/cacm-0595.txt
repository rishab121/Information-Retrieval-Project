guides to teaching cobol

the teaching of cobol can be divided into
three main subject areas  they are the syntax of 
cobol the use of such syntax in solving any given problem
and programming concepts  it is generally 
accepted that some knowledge of the hardware and computer
logic must be possessed by the programmer 
 the teaching problem arises in determining how thoroughly
a student must know the hardware and logic 
for that computer for which he will write cobol programs
 unfortunately historical data concerning 
students programming proficiency is almost non-existent
and at best difficult to measure  how then 
might we approach solving this problem
