a code for non-numeric information processing
applications in online systems

a code has been specifically designed to simplify
the internal information processing operations 
within an online computer system with respect to non-numeric
applications and to maximize the transfer 
rate of the information channel linking the system and
the system user  the code has direct application 
to problems in area such as information retrieval document
classification computer-aided teaching and 
text editing  this code called ipc information processing
code is an 8-bit code set constructed 
so that 7 6 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derived
from the basic set  the code set is organized 
so that simple binary operations can distinguish between
the numeric alphabetic special symbol and control 
character codes  the number of usable characters within
the basic set size may be expanded either by 
use of escape codes included in the set or by suitable
interpretation of otherwise unassigned codes 
on the basis of the requirements of local environments
