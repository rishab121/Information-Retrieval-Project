texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory  the patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping  several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included
