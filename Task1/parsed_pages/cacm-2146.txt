optimizing the polyphase sort

various dispersion algorithms for the polyphase
sorting procedure are examinedhe optimum 
algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unit
strings read is displayed  the logic of this 
algorithm is rather complicated hence several other
new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward 
logic are presented  of the simple dispersion algorithms
discussed the  horizontal is best  it does 
approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percent
less reading and writing than most algorithms in 
use today  an additional two and one-fourth to three
percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing 
the modified optimum algorithm  this algorithm is relatively
straightforward but it requires a fairly 
close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins
