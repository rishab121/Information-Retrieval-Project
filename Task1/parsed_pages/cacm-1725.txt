a simple proof of lewins ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory as described
by lewin is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values or of only one
value or contain no digits at all ie that the 
memory is empty  the use of these circuits which
in this paper are termed column value indicators 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory  lewin proves that for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words 2m  1 memory accesses are necessary  thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method unlike those of other methods is independent
of the word length  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented
