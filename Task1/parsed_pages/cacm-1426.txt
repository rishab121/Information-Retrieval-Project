a simulation of hospital admission policy

a study is described which simulates different
admission policies of a large specialized hospital 
 the objective is to determine better policies for
stabilization of admission and census rates while 
maintaining a reasonably full hospital  there types of
policies were examined admission based on percentages 
of discharge rates discharge rates plus or minus a
constant and fixed authorizations independent of 
discharge rates  the last type policy produced more stable
simulated results and when put into practice 
improvements were realized
