coding clinical laboratory data for automatic storage and retrieval

a series of clinical laboratory codes have been
developed to accept and store urin analysis blood 
chemistry and hematology test results for automatic
data processing  the codes although constructed 
as part of a computerized hospital simulation have been
able to handle the results of every laboratory 
test that they have encountered  the unique feature of
these codes is that they can accept conventionally 
recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results
 consequently clinical test results need 
not be arbitrarily stratified standardized or altered
in any way to be coded  this paper describes 
how the codes were developed and presents a listing of the
urin analysis codes  five criteria used in developing 
the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous
terminology is discussed  a solution to 
the problem is described  flexible computer-produced
composite laboratory reports are also discussed 
along with reproduction of such a report the paper concludes
that even though many problems remain unsolved 
the next ten years could witness the emergence of a practical
automated information system in the laboratory
