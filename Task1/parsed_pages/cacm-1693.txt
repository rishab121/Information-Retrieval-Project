gpl a truly general purpose language

a truly general purpose programming language
gpl is described which contains facilities for 
constructing within the language new data types as
well as facilities for operations performed upon 
them  the basic language is minimal in the sense that
no basic element can be derived from the others 
with high efficiency in the object programs  constructs
like the algol 60 for-statementsand if-statements 
are not basic they are special types of procedures
 new symbols underlined words in algol 60 are 
implicitly defined by usage in other declarations  as
part words are definable packed words are handled 
as easily as full words  address variables
pointers are included in full generality
