is that the sum of a set of numbers rounded 
in a generally understood manner be equal to the sum
of the numbers rounded individually  four rounding 
procedures are described to accomplish this  the particular
procedure that is appropriate depends upon

whether their sum can vary in sign and whether 
the last number being summed can be recognized as such prior to its rounding
