writing an outline debugging program for the experienced user

presently available online debugging routines
are often unsatisfactory for the experienced 
user because they require unnecessarily rigid and complicated
typing formats make it difficult for the 
user to correct typing errors and consume excessive
memory with intricate features  in a debugging 
program it is of prime importance that the program
be simple flexible and highly efficient to use 
 communication between the user and the debugging program
can be improved by using certain techniques 
applicable to most online debugging programs  these
techniques are presented and are illustrated by 
their use in opak octal package a debugging program coded
for the pdp-5/8 and the sds-930  the compromise 
between economy of utility program core storage and incorporation
of elegant debugging features is discussed
