algorithm and bound for the greatest common divisor of n integers

a new version of the euclidean
algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of n integers ai
and multipliers xi such that gcd  x1a1 +  + xnan
is presented  the number of arithmetic operations and the number
of storage locations are linear in n  a theorem of lame that gives a bound 
for the number of iterations of the euclidean algorithm for two integers 
is extended to the case of n integers  an algorithm to construct a minimal 
set of multipliers is presented  a fortran program for the algorithm appears 
as comm acm algorithm 386
