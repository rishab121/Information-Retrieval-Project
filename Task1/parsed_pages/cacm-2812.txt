computer-aided analysis and design of information systems

this paper describes the use of computer-aided
analysis for the design and development of an 
integrated financial management system by the navy material
command support activity nmcsa  computer-aided 
analysis consists of a set of procedures and computer
programs specifically designed to aid in the process 
of applications software design computer selection
and performance evaluation  there are four major 
components problem statement language problem statement
analyzer generator of alternative designs 
and performance evaluator the statement of requirements
was written in ads accurately defined systems 
and analyzed by a problem statement analyzer for ads
 the ads problem definition was supplemented with 
additional information in order to create a complete
problem definition  the analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
soda systems optimization and design algorithm
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures
