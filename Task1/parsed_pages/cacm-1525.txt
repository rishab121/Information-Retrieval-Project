on computing the fast fourier transform

cooley and tukey have proposed a fast algorithm
for computing complex fourier transform and 
have shown major time savings in using it to compute
large transforms on a digital computer  with n 
a power of two computing time for this algorithm is
proportional to n log2 n a major improvement over 
other methods with computing time proportional to n^2
 in this paper the fast fourier transform algorithm 
is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methods
for accurately computing the needed trigonometric 
function values are given  the problem of computing
a large fourier transform on a system with virtual 
memory is considered and a solution is proposed  this
method has been used to compute complex fourier 
transforms of size n  2^16 on a computer with 2^15
words of core storage this exceeds by a factor of 
eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixed
allocation of this amount of core storage  the 
method has also been used to compute large mixed radix
transforms  a scaling plan for computing the 
fast fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given
