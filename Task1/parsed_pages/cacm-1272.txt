in automatic abstracting citation indexing
mechanical translation and other such procedures 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity 
 heavy editing which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis  applications are described
such processes as factor analysis  applications 
are described such as the quick unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone
