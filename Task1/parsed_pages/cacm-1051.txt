multiword list items

the list concept as originally proposed by
newell simon and shaw specified single computer 
words as elements of a list  this report describes the
use of two or more consecutive words as one element 
 such use results in a considerable saving in both the
space required to hold a given amount of data 
and in the execution time required to perform a given
process on the data  following a brief description 
of standard list structures with single-word items the
multiword items are introduced  then variable-length 
items are described along with the corresponding space-utilization
problems  finally several examples 
are given to illustrate the use of multiword lists this
paper attempts to draw together various recent 
papers which have applied some of these concepts in different
ways and indicate how they relate to the 
more general problems
