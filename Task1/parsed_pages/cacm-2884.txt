permutation enumeration four new permutation algorithms

classical permutation enumeration algorithms encounter
special cases requiring additional computation 
every nth permutation when generating the n permutations
on n marks  four new algorithms have the attribute 
that special cases occur every nn-1permutations 
two of the algorithms produce the next permutation 
with a single exchange of two marks  the other two algorithms
infrequently exchange more than two marks 
but the rules for generating the next permutation are
very simple  performance tests which have counted 
execution of assignment statements comparisons arithmetic
operations and subscripted array references 
have shown superiority of the new algorithms compared to
boothroyds implementation of m b wells algorithm 
and ehrlichs implementation of the johnson-trotter algorithm
