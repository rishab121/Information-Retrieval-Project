least-squares analysis of resonance spectra on small computers

the problem of analyzing data from a mossbauer
effect experiment is discussed  by using the 
cut step procedure for convergence and by imposing physical
constraints on the functional form of the 
calculation it is possible to make the analysis on a
small computer  the analysis has been carried out 
on an ibm 1410 computer with a 40,000 bcd core memory
