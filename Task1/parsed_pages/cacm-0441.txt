topological sorting of large networks

topological sorting is a procedure required
for many problems involving analysis of networks 
 an example of one such problem is pert  the present
paper presents a very general method for obtaining 
topological order  it permits treatment of larger networks
than can be handled on present procedures 
and achieves this with greater efficiency  although
the procedure can be adapted to any machine it 
is discussed in terms of the 7090  a pert network of
30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one 
hour of machine time  the method was developed as
a byproduct of procedures needed by westinghouse 
baltimore  it has not been programmed and at present
there are no plans to implement it  in regard 
to the techniques described westinghouses present
and anticipated needs are completely served by the 
lockheed program which is in current use
