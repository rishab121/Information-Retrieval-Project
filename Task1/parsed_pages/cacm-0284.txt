manipulation of algebraic expressions

an algorithm for algebraically manipulating
expressions of the form sumcipi i1n has 
been developed in conjunction with the development of programs
for systems analysis problems  this algorithm 
enablesus to derive over-all system transfer functions
from algebraically described block diagrams of 
any linear continuous multi-loop feedback system  the
machine representation of the derived expression 
is by virtue of the algorithm in a form which simplifies
the task of compiling  the algorithm was 
developed for a particular purpose in connection with
system analysis studies  however its application 
as a mathematical device extends far beyond
the confines of the original problem
