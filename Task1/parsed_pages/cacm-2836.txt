weighted derivation trees

the nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associated
with weighting functions over the vocabulary 
of a context-free grammar  an algorithm is presented
for constructing the optimal derivation tree having 
the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree
 in addition the correctness of the algorithm 
is established  the method may be applied to problems
involving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial 
optimization
