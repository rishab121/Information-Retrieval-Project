an application of formac

a nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using formac 
is indicated  the solution of the problem using formac
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed  the problem is straightforward although
untenable by hand but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the formac language  the program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command  in particular it made extensive use of the
part command  several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
formac system  this paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in formac than with
the actual engineering problem although readers 
may be interested in the problem because it is stated
in a general mathematical sense and could be 
of interest in areas other than circuit analysis
