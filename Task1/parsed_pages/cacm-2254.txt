dynamic partitioning for array languages

the classical process of partitioning an array
into subarrays is extended to a more useful 
array language operation  various modes of partitioning
are defined for different types of arrays so 
that subarrays may vary over the original array in
a nearly arbitrary manner  these definitions are 
motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate
the value of partitioning for array languages 
 of general interest is the data structure for partitioning
 this consists of dynamic tree structures 
which are used to derive and maintain the array control
information  these are described in sufficient 
detail to be of value in the design of other array languages
 the description presented in this paper 
is implemented in a new array language ol/2 currently
under development at the university of illinois
