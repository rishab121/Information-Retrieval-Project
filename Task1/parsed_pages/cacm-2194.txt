how to keep the addresses short

an algorithm is presented for minimizing the
sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced 
by an assembler or compiler when 1 the length of
each computer instruction is assumed to be either 
long or short long if the memory location addressed
is more than a predetermined distance from 
the current location short otherwise and 2
there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings 
origins are separated by prespecified amounts for example
some computers permit either 8-bit addressing 
interpreted relative to the location counter or full
16-bit addressing of all of memory  when assembling 
or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which
have many mutual references in such a computer 
there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping
as many of the addresses short as possible  this 
paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems of
this type can be formulated as covering problems 
solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operations
on the column vectors of a ternary matrix
