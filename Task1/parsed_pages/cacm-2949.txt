a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate each node must have 
information about the networks topology  since nodes
and links sometimes crash a scheme is needed 
to update this information  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network  it is based on barans hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented
