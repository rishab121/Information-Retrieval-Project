an analysis of inline substitution for a structured programming language

an optimization technique known as inline substitution
is analyzed  the optimization consists 
of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copy
of the procedure body  the general problem of 
using inline substitution to minimize execution time
subject to size constrain ts is formulated and an 
approximate algorithmic solution is proposed  the algorithm
depends on run-time statistics about the 
program to be optimized  preliminary results for the
clu structured programming language indicate that 
in programs with a low degree of recursion over 90
percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated 
with little increase in the size of compiled code and a
small savings in execution time  other conclusions 
based on these results are also presented
