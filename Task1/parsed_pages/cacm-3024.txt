the cray-1 computer system

this paper describes the cray-1 discusses
the evolution of its architecture and gives an 
account of some of the problems that were overcome during
its manufacture  the cray-1 is the only computer 
to have been built to date that satisfies erdas class
vi requirement a computer capable of processing 
from 20 to 60 million floating point operations per
second 1  the cray-1s fortran compiler cft 
is designed to give the scientific user immediate access
to the benefits of the cray-1s vector processing 
architecture  an optimizing compiler cft vectorizes
innermost do loops  compatible with the ansi 
1966 fortran standard and with many commonly supported
fortran extensions cft does not require any source 
program modifications or the use of additional nonstandard
fortran statements to achieve vectorization 
 thus the users investment of hundreds of man months
of effort to develop fortran programs for other 
contemporary computers is protected
