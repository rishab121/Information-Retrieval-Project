an algorithm for the probability of
the union of a large number of events

an algorithm is presented which efficiently evaluates
the probability for the union of n independent 
and not mutually exclusive events the problem is that
of evaluating the sums of the products of all 
possible combinations of n variables in minimum time and storage space
