interference between communicating parallel processes

various kinds of interference between communicating
parallel processes have been examined by 
dijkstra knuth and others  solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems in the form of parallel programs and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions  in this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state s ie a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations to a next state 
s in accordance with a transition rule s  s  a
set of such rules yields sequences of states which 
dictate the systems behavior  the mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states or
of the existence of certain sequences  a mechanical 
proof procedure is shown which will either verify prove
the correctness of  or discredit prove the 
incorrectness of an attempted solution with respect
to any of the interference properties  it is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the partial
rules by which the individual processes operate 
 the formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes and
symmetry between processes is not required
