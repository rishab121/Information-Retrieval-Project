the next 700 programming languages 

a family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework  this framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships  within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts  one is the choice of written appearances 
of programs or more generally their physical representation
 the other is the choice of the abstract 
entities such as numbers character-strings lists
of them functional relations among them that can 
be referred to in the language  the system is biased
towards expressions rather than statements 
 it includes a nonproceduralpurely functional subsystem
that aims to expand the class of users needs 
that can be met by a single print-instruction without sacrificing
the important properties that make 
conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand
