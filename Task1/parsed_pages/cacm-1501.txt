eigenvectors of a 2n x 2n matrix

it has been known that the eigenvalues of a
certain 2n x 2n matrix can be obtained by use of 
two smaller matrices of order n which can be easily
constructed  an algorithm is given to obtain the 
eigenvectors of the 2n x 2n matrix by use of
the eigenvectors of the smaller matrices
