the organization of structured files

a data file is an integral part of a data processing
system  in many systems the selection 
of an organization for the data within the file can
be critical to the systems operating efficiency 
 this paper provides the systems designer with an information
source which describes ten techniques that 
may be employed for organizing structured data  the
characteristics of the organizations described are 
application independent thus providing the designer with
a reference which allows him to limit the number 
of file organizations he must consider for his system
