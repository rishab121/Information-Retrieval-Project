vmin-an optimal variable-space page replacement algorithm

a criterion for comparing variable space page
replacement algorithms is presented  an optimum 
page replacement algorithm called vmin is described and
shown to be optimum with respect to this criterion 
the results of simulating vmin dennings working set
and the page partitioning replacement algorithms 
on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate
the improvement possible over the known 
realizable variable space algorithms
