language analysis in the humanities

the use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
as in indices and concordances is widespread and accepted
as desirable  the implications of the computer 
for a science of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted
 this paper argues that the computers  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary eg analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition the computer
can be a critically important facilitator
