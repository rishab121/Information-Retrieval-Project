the working set model for program behavior

probably the most basic reason behind the absence
of a general treatment of resource allocation 
in modern computer systems is an adequate model for
program behavior  in this paper a new model the 
working set model is developed the working set
of pages associated with a process defined to be 
the collection of its most recently used pages provides
knowledge vital to the dynamic management of 
paged memories  process and working set are shown to
be manifestations of the same ongoing computational 
activity then processor demand and memory demand
are defined and resource allocation is formulated 
as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment
