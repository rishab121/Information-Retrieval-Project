the optimal approach to recursive programs

the classical fixed poin t approach toward recursive
programs suggests choosing the least defined 
fixed poin t as the most appropriate solution to a recursive
program  a new approach is described which 
in troduction an  optimal fixed point which in contrast
to the least defined fixed poin t embodies the 
maximal amount of valuable information embedded in the
program  the practical implications of this approach 
are discussed and techniques for proving properties
of optimal fixed poin t are given  the presentation 
is informal with emphasis on examples
