on the expected gain from adjust ing matched term retrieval systems

a file adjustment procedure based on maximizing
the bayes expected gain proposed for matched 
term retrieval systems  the expected gain and its probability
distribution are derived as a function 
of 1 the prior proportion of omitted terms and 2 the
coefficient of separation between two distributions 
corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic  an
example evaluates the gain parameters for a typical 
information retrieval system
