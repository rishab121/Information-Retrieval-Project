a deductive question-answer for natural language inference

the question-answering aspects of the protosynthex iii pro
totype language processing system are described and exemplified in
detail  the system is written in lisp 1.5 and operates on the q-32
time-sharing system  the systems data structures and their semantic
organization the deductive question-answering formalism of
relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators and
the question-answering procedures which employ these features in
their operation are all described and illustrated  examples of the
systems performance and of the limitations of its question-answering 
capability are presented and discussed  it is shown that the
use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly 
facilitates the process and that a top-down procedure which works
from question to answer enables effective use to be made of this
information  it is concluded that the development of protosynthex
iii into a practically useful system to work with large data
bases is possible but will require changes in both the data
structures and the algorithms used for question answering
