the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical problems

with the advent of on-line time-sharing computer systems
and graphic terminals we have available a new dimension
in numerical problem solving capabilities  rather than simply use
the new power to achieve fast turnaround we can develop interactive
routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the
insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver  several
on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving
have already been implemented as well as some special purpose
systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary
differential equations  the advantage of restricting the problem
area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified
in this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
systems and design considerations for interactive routines  furthermore
an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting
program peg is presented with results obtained from empirical
data  in conclusion area for future work in this field are discussed
