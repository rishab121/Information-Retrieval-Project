progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database integrity

a progressive acyclic digraph pad algorithm accepts are requests and
maintains a graph in an acyclic state  when a request creates a cycle
nodes are detached until the new are can be entered acyclically
this process is important in certain areas of database implementation
in which there are constraints on the permissible sequences
of actions two pad algorithms are presented one uses a simple
path matrix representation and the other uses a list with an
artificial gradient  experiments suggest that for large n the second
is considerably faster though both are asymptotically onr
where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected number
of nodes reachable along paths from any given node
