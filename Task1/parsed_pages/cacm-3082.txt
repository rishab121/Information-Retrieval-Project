time clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed system

the concept of one event happening before
another in a distributed system is examined and
is shown to define a partial ordering of the events
 a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing 
a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally
order the events  the use of the total ordering 
is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization
problems  the algorithm is then specialized 
for synchronizing physical clocks and a bound is derived
on how far out of synchrony the clocks can 
become
