dynamic space-sharing in computer systems

a formalization of relationships between space-shading
program behavior and processor efficiency 
in computer systems is presented  concepts of value and
cost of space allocation per task are defined 
and then value and cost are combined to develop a single
parameter termed value per unit cost  the intent 
is to illustrate a possible analytic approach to the
investigation of the problems of space-sharing and 
to demonstrate the method on sample problems
