an analytic model of the hasp execution task monitor

the hasp execution task monitor periodically
rearranges the os/360 dispatching chain to give 
tasks preemptive execution priority in inverse order to
that of their cpu utilization history  the effect 
is to keep the i/o bound tasks active and to prevent
cpu bound tasks from locking out other tasks  this 
paper develops a simple model of the execution task
monitor and employs it to study the effectiveness 
of the monitor in improving system performance  a
modified strategy monitor control is investigated 
for the case of task execution in a memory hierarchy of varying speeds
