approximate solution of initial boundary wave
equation problems by boundary-value techniques

a new boundary-value technique is proposed for
the treatment of initial-boundary-value problems 
for linear and mildly nonlinear wave equations   several
illustrative examples are offered to demonstrate 
the ease with which the method can be applied
