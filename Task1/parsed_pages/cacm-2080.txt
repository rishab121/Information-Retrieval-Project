the nucleus of a multiprogramming system

this paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse 
requirements of program scheduling and resource allocation  the system
nucleus simulates an environment in which program execution and input/output
are handled uniformly as parallel cooperating process
es  a fundamental set of primitives allows the dynamic creation and control
of a hierarchy of processes as well as the communication among them
