context-sensitive parsing

this paper presents a canonical form for context-sensitive
derivations and a parsing algorithm which finds
each context-sensitive analysis once and only once  the amount of memory
required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to 
store a single complete derivation  in addition a modified
version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses 
for grammars which contain loops  the algorithm is
also compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitive
grammars and general rewriting systems and the difference between
the two types of analyses is discussed  the algorithm appears to
be complementary to an algorithm by s kuno in several respects including 
the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved
