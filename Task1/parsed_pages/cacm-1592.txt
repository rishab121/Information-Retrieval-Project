string similarity and misspellings

the problem of programming a computer to determine
whether or not a string of characters is 
a misspelling of a given word was considered  a numberof
algorithms were evaluated-some proposed by 
other writers some by the author  these techniques
were tested on a collection of misspellings made 
by students at various grade levels  while many of
the methods were clearly unsatisfactory some gave 
as few as 2.1 percent incorrect determinations
