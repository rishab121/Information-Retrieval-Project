generating beta variates with nonintegrel shape parameters

a new rejection method is described for generating
beta variates  the method is compared with 
previously published methods both theoretically and through
computer timings  it is suggested that the 
method has advantages in both speed and programming
simplicity over previous methods especially for 
difficult combinations of parameter values
