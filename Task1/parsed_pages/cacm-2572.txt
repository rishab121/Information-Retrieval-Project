arguments for a moratorium on the construction
of a community information utility

in this article the author urges a prudent
and decentralized approach to the question of the 
design and desirability of computerized community information
utilities  before accepting the inevitability 
and desirability of this or any technology we should
1 be sure of the feasibility internally and 
externally of what is proposed 2 project and perhaps
wait for changes in complementary techniques 
3 evaluate current and projected supplementary techniques
4 establish the existence of demand for 
what is proposed 5 take steps to involve a representative
group of ultimate users in systems design 
and 6 carefully think through possible side effects
on man and his world view  current proposals for 
community information utilities are examined in this
framework and the conclusion is drawn that society 
is not yet in a position to justify either the construction
of an information utility in a prototype 
community or the acceptance of a policy in
favor of its widespread implementation
