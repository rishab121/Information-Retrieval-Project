23,1 january 1976

a new algorithm for global flow analysis on
reducible graphs is presented the algorithm is 
shown to treat a very general class of function spaces
 for a graph of e edges the algorithm has a 
worst case time bound of oe log e function operations
 it is also shown that in programming terms 
the number of operations is proportional to e plus the
number of exits from program loops  consequently 
a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures
linearity  the algorithm can be extended to yet 
larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing
the time bound  examples are given of code 
improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm
