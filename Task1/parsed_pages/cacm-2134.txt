an extension of the munkres algorithm for
the assignment problem to rectangular matrices

the assignment problem together with munkres
proposed algorithm for its solution in square 
matrices is presented first  then the authors develop
an extension of this algorithm which permits 
a solution for rectangular matrices  timing results
obtained by using an adapted version of silvers 
algol procedure are discussed and a relation between
solution time and problem size is given
