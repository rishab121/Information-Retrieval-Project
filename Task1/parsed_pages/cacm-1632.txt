programming the tabular method of analysis
of variance for factorial experiments 

the ease of programming the tabular method of analysis
of variance for complete factorial experiments 
in a fortran language is demonstrated  in this method
the total sum of squares is partitioned into 
orthogonal single degree of freedom sums of squares
main effect and interaction sums of squares are 
then obtained by appropriate pooling of the single degree
of freedom sums of squares  program segments 
to accomplish the procedure are presented  modifications
to handle hierarchical designs and replicated 
experiments are mentioned a fortran ii program
for an ibm 7094 is described briefly
