an efficient data structure for the simulation event set

recently algorithms have been presented for the
realization of event scheduling routines suitable 
for general purpose discrete event simulation systems
 several exhibited a performance superior to that 
of commonly used simple linked list algorithms  in this
paper a new event scheduling algorithm is presented 
which improves on two aspects of the best of the previously
published algorithms  first the new algorithms 
performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions
and second its worst-case complexity is o 
n where n is the number of events in the set  furthermore
tests conducted to estimate the average 
complexity showed it to be nearly independent of n
