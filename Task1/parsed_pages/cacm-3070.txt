hybrid simulation models of computer systems

this paper describes the structure and operation
of a hybrid simulation model in which both 
discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques are
combined to produce efficient yet accurate system 
models  in an example based on a simple hypothetical
computer system discrete-event simulation is used 
to model the arrival and activation of jobs and a
central-server queueing network models the use of 
system processors  the accuracy and efficiency of the
hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing 
the result and computational costs of the hybrid model of
the example with those of an equivalent simulation-only 
model
