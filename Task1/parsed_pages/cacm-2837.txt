new upper bounds for selection

the worst-case minimum number of comparisons
complexity vin of the i-th selection problem 
is considered  a new upper bound for vin improves the
bound given by the standard hadian-sobel algorithm 
by a generalization of the kirkpatrick-hadian-sobel
algorithm and extends kirkpatricks method to a 
much wider range of application  this generalization
compares favorably with a recent algorithm by hyafil
