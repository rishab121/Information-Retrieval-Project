programming systems and languages 1965-1975

in spite of impressive gains by pl/i fortran
and cobol remain the languages in which most 
of the worlds production programs are written and will
remain so into the foreseeable future  there 
is a great deal of theoretical interest in algol 68
and in extensible languages but so far at least 
they have had little practical impact  problem-oriented
languages may very well become the most important 
language development area in the next five to ten years
 in the operating system area all major computer 
manufacturers set out to produce very ambitious multiprogramming
systems and they all ran into similar 
problems  a number of university projectsthough not
directly comparable to those of the manufacturers 
have contributed greatly to a better understanding
of operating system principles  important trends 
include the increased interest in the development of
system measurement and evaluation techniquesand 
increased use of microprogramming for some programming system functions
