on simulating networks of parallel processes
in which simultaneous events may occur

some of the problems of simulating discrete
event systems particularly computer systems on 
a conventional digital computer are dealt with  the
systems are assumed to be described as a network 
of interconnected sequential processes  briefly reviewed
are the common techniques used to handle such 
simulations when simultaneous events do not occur can
be ignored or can be handled by simple priority 
rules  following this the problem of dealing with simultaneous
events in separate processes is introduced 
 an abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems  the technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found  in some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending 
the information available to the solution technique but
in many cases the technique becomes computationally 
unfeasible when the additional information is provided
