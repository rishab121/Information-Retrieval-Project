an anomaly in space-time characteristics of
certain programs running in a paging machine

the running time of programs in a paging machine
generally increases as the store in which 
programs are constrained to run decreases  experiments
however have revealed cases in which the reverse 
is true a decrease in the size of the store is accompanied
by a decrease in running time  an informal 
discussion of the anomalous behavior is given and for
the case of the fifo replacement algorithm a formal 
treatment is presented
