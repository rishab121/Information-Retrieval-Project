the self-judgment method of curve fitting

a computer-oriented method for processing and
communicating numerical data is described  the 
instrument reliability factors irf which exactly
define the limits of reliability of each measured 
item of information are used to compute the maximum
permitted error mpe associated with each values 
of each ordinate  the self-judgment principle sjp
is used to discard wrong information and to compute 
mean values of the parameters and their mpes in terms
of the irf  data compatibility tests with any 
number of different equations can be made quickly 
otherwise intractable problems are easily solved 
and the design of many experiments is greatly simplified
 the computational and mathematical techniques 
used to reduce bias in the sjp are discussed  inadequacies
in the statistical and graphical methods 
of curve fitting are noted
