reducing truncation errors by programming

in accumulating a sum such as in a numerical
integration with a large number of intervals 
the sum itself becomes much larger than the individual
addends  this may produce a less accurate sum 
as the number of intervals is increased  separate variables
can be established as accumulators to hold 
partial sums within various distinct intervals  thus
the extensive successive truncations are eliminated
