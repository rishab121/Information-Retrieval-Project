the eschenbach drum scheme

the prime function of a drum operating in
real time is to perform accesses quickly  the 
usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate
engineering or hardware improvements  in 
this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the
drum but rather by modifying the manner in which 
it operates  at the outset a drum is given a functional
definition  then a simple design scheme eschenbach 
is introduced which enormously increases the rate of
accessing for drums so defined  this is shown to 
enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or
less expensive drums  it is suggested that although 
the design scheme has a specific use the method underlying it
has more general applicability  the question 
of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised  to
deal with this a standard of efficiency is developed 
in light of realistic real-time circumstances  the drum
scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits 
it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory 
thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum 
scheme is efficient enough for its application  again
whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a 
specific use the methods underlying it have more general applicability
