a terminal-oriented communication system

this paper describes a system for full-duplex
communication between a time-shared computer 
and its terminals  the system consists of a communications
computer directly connected to the time-shared 
system a number of small remote computers to which
the terminals are attached and connecting medium 
speed telephone lines  it can service a large number
of terminals of various types  the overall system 
design is presented along with the algorithms used to
solve three specific problems local echoing error 
detection and correction on the telephone lines
and multiplexing of character output
