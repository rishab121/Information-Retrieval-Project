formal parsing systems

automatic syntactic analysis has recently become
important for both natural language data processing 
and syntax-directed compilers  a formal parsing system
g  vutr consists of two finite disjoint 
vocabularies v and t a many-many map u from v onto
t and a recursive set r of strings in t called 
syntactic sentence classes  every program for automatic
syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing 
system  a directed production analyzer itxp is a
nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal 
vocabulary i input vocabulary t and all productions
of p in the form  za  ay1  ym where  z 
yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the
set t  every context-free language can be analyzed 
by a directed production analyzer  the kuno-oettinger
multiple-path syntactic analyzer for english is 
a concrete example of a directed production analyzer
and of a working parsing algorithm  the connection 
between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of
a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined
