a methodology for calculating and
optimizing real-time system performance

the continually increasing size complexity
number of types and cost of data processing systems 
are causing serious re-examination within government
and industry of the criteria for and methods of 
calculating and optimizing data processing system cost
and performance  real-time data processing systems 
as typified by the automated airline reservation system
are discussed in this paper  criteria for evaluating 
performance are described a methodology for calculating
and optimizing is outlined and the method is 
illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performance
calculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented 
message switching system
