a software design and evaluation system

a critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented  in this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed  a system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described 
 this system is based on a simple high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development  the source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines  using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system
