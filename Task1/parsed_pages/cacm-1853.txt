compact list representation definition
garbage collection and system implementation

compact lists are stored sequentially in memory
rather than chained with pointers  since 
this is not always convenient the swym system permits
a list to be chained compact or any combination 
of the two  a description is given of that list representation
and the operators implemented most are 
similar to those of lisp 1.5  the system garbage collector
attempts to make all lists compact it relocates 
and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage
 this unique list-compacting garbage collection 
algorithm is presented in detail  several classes of the
macros used to implement the system are described 
 finally consideration is given to those design factors
essential to the success of a plex processing 
system implementation
