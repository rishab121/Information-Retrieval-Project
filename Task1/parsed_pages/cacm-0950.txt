parallel methods for integrating ordinary differential equations

this paper is dedicated to the proposition that
in order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly parallel computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
parallel form  by this is meant that serial 
algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which
consist of several subtasks which can be computed 
without knowledge of the results of the other subtasks 
as an example a method is proposed for parallelizing 
the numerical integration of an ordinary differential
equation which process by all standard methods 
is entirely serial
