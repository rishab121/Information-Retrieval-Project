orderly enumeration of nonsingular binary
matrices applied to text encryption

nonsingular binary matrices of order n ie
nonsingular over the field 0 1 and an initial 
segment of the natural numbers are placed in one-to-one
correspondence  each natural number corresponds 
to two intermediate vectors  these vectors are mapped into
a nonsingular binary matrix  examples of 
complete enumeration of all 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 nonsingular
binary matrices were produced by mapping the 
intermediate vectors to the matrices  the mapping
has application to the vernam encipherment method 
using pseudorandom number sequences  a bit string formed
form bytes of text of a data encryption key 
can be used as a representation of a natural number 
this natural number is transformed to a nonsingular 
binary matrix  key leverage is obtained by using the
matrix as aseed in a shift register sequence 
pseudorandom number generator
