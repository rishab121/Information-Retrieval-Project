an interference matching technique for inducing abstractions

a method for inducing knowledge by abstraction
from a sequence of training examples is described 
 the proposed method interference matching induces abstractions
by finding relational properties common 
to two or more exemplars  three tasks solved by a program
that uses an interference-matching algorithm 
are presented  several problems concerning the description
of the training examples and the adequacy 
of interference matching are discussed and directions
for future research are considered
