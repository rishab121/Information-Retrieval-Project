a view of computer architecture

an attempt is made to predict the developments
of the next 25 years in the field of computer 
architecture  standardized inexpensive microcomputers
on a single chip are predicted  these will be 
used extensively to provide logical functions for noncomputational
devices and incidentally for the design 
of superscale computers
