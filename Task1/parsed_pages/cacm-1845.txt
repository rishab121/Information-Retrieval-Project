loader standardization for overlay programs

the overlay capability is described for four
of the third generation computer systems cdc-6000 
ge-635 ibm-360 and univac-1108  a critique of the
first three systems is based on actual experience 
with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program
a short history and description of this program 
is presented  a standardization of minimum capabilities
for loaders is recommended so that programs 
which must operate under more than one computer system
may be easily converted and maintained  a proposal 
that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation
specification concept instead of the conditional 
tree structure is delineated  this concept provides
more efficient and cost-effective utilization of 
the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure
