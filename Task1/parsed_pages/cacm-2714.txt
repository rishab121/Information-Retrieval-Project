merging with parallel processors

consider two linearly ordered sets a b am
bn mn and p pm parallel processors 
working synchronously  the paper presents an algorithm
for merging a and b with the p parallel processors 
which requires at most 2log2 2m+1+3m/p + m/plog2
n/m steps  if n  2^bm b an integer 
the algorithm requires at most 2log2 m+1 + m/p2+b
steps  in the case where m and n are of the 
same order of magnitude ie nkm with k being a constant
the algorithm requires 2log2 m+1 + m/p3+k 
steps  these performances compare very favorably with
the previous best parallel merging algorithm 
batchers algorithm which requires n/p + m+n/2plog2 m
steps in the general case and km/p + k+1/2m/plog2 
m in the special case where nkm
