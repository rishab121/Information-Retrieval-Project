a fast method for solving a class of tridiagonal linear systems

the solution of linear systems having real symmetric
diagonally dominanttridiagonal coefficient 
matrices with constant diagonals is considered  it is
proved that the diagonals of the lu decomposition 
converges when floating-point precision  it is also
proved that the computed lu decomposition converges 
when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits
of the lu diagonals using floating point are 
roughly within machine precision of the limits using
real arithmetic  this fact is exploited to reduce 
the number of floating-point operations required to
solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3 where 
k is much less than n the order of the matrix  if the
elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals 
are 1 then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed  the
entire lu decomposition takes k words of storage 
and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved
 upper and lower bounds on k are obtained 
in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal
constants and parameters of the floating-point 
number system  various generalizations of these results are discussed
