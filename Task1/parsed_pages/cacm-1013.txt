final examination scheduling

a method for scheduling final examinations
to yield a minimal number of student conflicts is 
described  the minimization is achieved by repetitively
evaluating a nonlinear set of equations  
imbeded in the process is a random or monte carlo selection
of assignments  as in such heuristic techniques 
the solution may not be optimum and many solutions
may be found which yield locally minimal results 
 computer programs are described and empirical results given
