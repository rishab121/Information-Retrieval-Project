implications of structured programming for machine architecture

based on an empirical study of more than 10,000
lines of program text written in a goto-less 
language a machine architecture specifically designed for
structured programs is proposed  since assignment 
call return and if statements together account for
93 percent of all executable statements special 
care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented
efficiently  a highly compact instruction 
encoding scheme is presented which can reduce program
size by a factor of 3  unlike a huffman code 
which utilizes variable length fields this method uses
only fixed length 1-byte op code and address 
fields  the most frequent instructions consist of a
single 1-byte field  as a consequence instruction 
decoding time is minimized and the machine is
efficient with respect to both space and time
