starting approximations for square root calculation on ibm system/360

several starting approximations for square
root calculation by newtons method are presented 
in a form to facilitate their use in ibm system/360 square
root routines  these approximations include 
several for the range 1/16 1 which is the interval
of primary interest on ibm system/360
