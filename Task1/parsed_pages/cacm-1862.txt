computing capabilities at argentine and chilean universities

the author reports on a trip to universities in
argentina and chile during november 1968 describing 
university conditions and computing activities  as elsewhere
these universities are experiencing student 
discontent with the status quo and the solutions they
are attempting contrast argentina is excluding 
students from participating in university government
chile is allowing such participation  university 
computing service and academic activities are limited
 the number of computers is small and so is the 
capacity none larger than an ibm 360/40 with some
exception computing science academic programs are 
rare this situation is by no means attributable to
those responsible for computing developments who 
strive for excellence rather the system is hard to
over-come  universities especially those with 
strong european traditions adapt slowly to new academic
resources and disciplines superimposed are 
the severe technological and economic constraints of the
developing nation  consequently in the absence 
of conscious government emphasis on strengthening computing
capabilities future progress may be retarded
