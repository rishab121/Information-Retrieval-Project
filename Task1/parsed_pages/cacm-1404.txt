computational aspects of multiple covariance
analysis on a multifactor structure

the computational procedure for the analysis
of multiple covariance in statistics is discussed 
with reference to the analysis of variance  a special
operator calculus developed by hartly for programming 
analysis of variance for multifactor experiments is extended
to cover the analysis of covariance  this 
extension is accomplished by utilizing the connection
between the analysis of covariance and the analysis 
of variance and by introducing a new operator  the
results are illustrated by a numerical example for 
analysis of covariance in which the basic computations
are shown to be carried out by an analysis-of-variance 
program
