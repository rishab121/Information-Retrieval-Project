mux a simple approach to on-line computing

an on-line system operating as part of a normal
batch system for the cdc 6600 computer is described 
 the system which required one man-year for initial
software implementation although basically simple
provides the necessary elements to input and modify files
submit them for batch execution and provide 
results at the users terminal  a multiplexer designed
and developed as part of the project cost one 
man-year for design and checkout and $16,000 for parts
and fabrication  all aspects of the system are 
described including design criteria implementation
cost overhead and user reactions
