a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer    all aspects of the system including
all relevant code and data bases may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert  this function is applied to the
users password and the result compared to a table 
entry a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output  this paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable h  two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely  finally
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed
