architecture of the ibm system/370

this paper discusses the design considerations
for the architectural extensions that distinguish 
system/370 from system/360  it comments on some experiences
with the original objectives for system/360 
and on the efforts to achieve them and it describes the
reasons and objectives for extending the architecture 
it covers virtual storage program control data-manipulation
instructions timing facilities multiprocessing
