sampling from the gamma distribution on a computer

this paper describes a method of generating
gamma variates that appears to be less costly than 
wallaces recently suggested method  for large shape parameter
a the cost of computation is proportional 
to a whereas wallaces method is proportional to a
 experimentation by robinson and lewis indicates 
that for small a the method suggested here also dominates
methods recently suggested by dieter and 
ahrens albeit those methods dominate for large a  the
method suggested here uses the rejection technique
