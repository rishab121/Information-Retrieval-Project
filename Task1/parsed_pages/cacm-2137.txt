new lisp techniques for a paging environment

the system described herein employs the block
concept and that of global and local variables 
in addition to the methods applied in most lisp systems
 also a new means of list representation is 
used local sequential for lists created during compilation
and block level sequential for those 
created dynamically  a new garbage collection algorithm
has been introduced to make lists as compact 
as possible partial garbage collection is performed after
each block exit instead of total garbage collection 
when storage is exhausted  the algorithm does not use
the customary flagging procedure  this combination 
of features has eliminated the need for a free list
and effectively minimizes the number of pages used 
at any moment
