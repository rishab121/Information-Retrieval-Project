a multiuser computation facility for education and research

present-day computing facilities are limited
in their value for scientific research by inability 
to interact strongly with users  the full power of a
research computing instrument should be available 
at many terminals that give each user the ability to generate
correct and operate any procedure he wishes 
either simple or complex  implementation is described
for a small-scale multiuser computer system that 
permits several users to work independently with the
machine and to obtain satisfactory response using 
typewriter communication
