analysis and performance of inverted data base structures

the need to envision and architecture data base
systems in a hierarchical level by level framework 
is stressed the inverted data base file organization
is then analyzed considering implementation 
oriented aspects  the inverted directory is viewed realistically
as another large data base which itself 
is subjected to inversion  formulations are derived
to estimate average access time read only and 
storage requirements formalizing the interaction of data
base content characteristics logical complexity 
of queries and machine timing and blocking specifications
identified as having a first-order effect 
on performance  the formulations presented are necessary
to be used in conjunction with any index selection 
criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys
