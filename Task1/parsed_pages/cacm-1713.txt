on overcoming high-priority paralysis
in multiprogramming systems a case his tory

high-priority paralysis is the degradation
that can occur in multiprogramming systems when 
scheduling is based primarily on preassigned priorities
 it can be alleviated by modifying the scheduling 
algorithm to maximize the number of programs active
at one time  the case his tory given in this paper 
indicates two general methods by which simultaneity can
be increased  possible refinements in the scheduling 
algorithm for future improvements are considered briefly
