computer photocomposition of technical text

in computer assisted typesetting by means of
photocomposition special problems arise in highly 
technical material such as mathematical formulas  new
solutions to several of these problems have been 
devised in the information system of the american institute
of physics  they include the representation 
of special characters foreign alphabets mathematical
symbols etc not available on input keyboards 
or on the photocomposer the generation of such symbols
eg by overprinting the precise positioning 
of accent marks floating diacritics line breaks
ie words or formulas placed partly at the end of 
one line and partly at the beginning of the next
and certain aspects of error correction
