an extended arithmetic package

in many fields for example algebraic number
theory arithmetic must be carried out to a degree 
of precision which exceeds the normal hardware capacity
of most machines  in such cases an extended 
arithmetic package provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use
way of performing such arithmetic  such 
a package was coded for the ibm 7090  in discussing
the general problems associated with the design 
of an extended arithmetic package specific reference is made to this program
