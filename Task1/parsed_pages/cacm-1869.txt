block structures indirect addressing and garbage collection

programming languages have included explicit
or implicit block structures to provide a naming 
convenience for the programmer  however when indirect
addressing is used as in snobol naming constraints 
may be introduced  two modifications to snobol are described
resulting in two desirable consequences 
1 naming constraints disappear even when there is
indirect addressing within function definitions 
and 2 there is a significant saving in the number of
calls to the garbage collector because some garbage 
is collected at little expense each time a function
returns to its calling program  these modifications 
have been implemented as an extension to a snobol dialect
