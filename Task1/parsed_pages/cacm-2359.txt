an improved index sequential access method using hashed overflow

the index sequential access method isam is
one of the most important file management systems 
used with moveable head disk devices  this study investigates
the use of an unconventional method of 
treating overflow records  the method is to use hashing
techniques to allocate space for such records 
 if certain conditions are satisfied this is superior
to the conventional isam method of chaining the 
overflow records via linked list techniques  these conditions are
long overflow chains with significant 
overflow lack of tight disk space constraints record
keys which are small compared to the total record 
size and significant use of the file in the index as opposed
to the sequential mode  using hashed overflow 
the time to locate a record is dependent not on the total
volume of overflow records as in conventional 
isam but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records
