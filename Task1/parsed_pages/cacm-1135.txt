a general business-oriented language based on decision expressions

the structure of a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented  such
a structure based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class permits writing extremely compact 
programs even for comparatively complex applications
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application  furthermorelocal changes of 
a process eg changes affecting only one of the output
files involved can be effected by local modifications 
in the program eg modification of only one entry of the
tables  this structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes 
 the approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies  it stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages as opposed to emphasizing 
formal ie contents-independent syntactical definitions
 it relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets tables of relations
between data and results there are no control 
statements such as go to etc instead of using procedure
descriptions which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts  here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes  this new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by codasyl for such languages 
including machine-independence
