git-a heuristic program for testing pairs
of directed line graphs for isomorphism

given a pair of directed line graphs the problem
of ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic 
is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known
 since a straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years of running time on a very high
speed computer in order to compare two 15-node 
graphs a more sophisticated approach seems called
for  the situation is similar to that prevailing 
in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving where
practical algorithms are unknown for the interesting 
cases but where various practical though only partially
successful techniques are available  git-graph 
isomorphism tester-incorporates a variety of processes
that attempt to narrow down the search for an 
isomorphism or to demonstrate that none exists  no one
scheme is relied upon exclusively for a solution 
and the program is designed to avoid excessive computation
along fruitless lines  git has been written 
in the comit language and successfully tested on the ibm 7090
