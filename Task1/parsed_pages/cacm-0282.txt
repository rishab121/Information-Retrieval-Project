optimum tape-writing procedures

consider a magnetic tape system with a read
check after writing  where an error occurs in 
writing a record a programmed error routine may either
bypass some or all of the area on tape or try 
to rewrite the record on the same area  this paper evaluates
these two procedures on the basis of expected 
loss of computer time and develops a decision rule for
selecting the optimum procedure  the rule depends 
critically on the number of times the tape being written
will be used in the future  in the case where 
the optimum procedure is to bypass an area a second
decision-the size of the area to be bypassed-is 
necessary  a formula is developed to determine the
optimum area to be bypassed for each procedure
