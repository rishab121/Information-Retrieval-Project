multilevel operating systems

the basic software for all newer computers
is built on the well-established need for standard 
operating systems this implies that all applications-no
matter how large complex or time consuming-must 
operate under or more precisely on top of the standard
system  large applications require supervisory 
monitors which handle problems similar to those of
the operating systems but at a different level  
sometimes still a third or even a fourth such level
is required or desirable  this leads naturally 
to the concept of multilevel systems-similar vertically
but different horizontally  proper division 
of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency and
less logical complexity while actually 
enhancing capability
