a formalism for translator interactions

a formalism is presented for describing the actions
of processors for programming languages-compilers
interpreters assemblers-and their interactions in complex systems
such as compiler-compilers or extendible languages
the formalism here might be used to define and answer such a
question as can one do bootstrapping using a meta-compiler 
whose metaphase is interpretive  in addition an algorithm
is presented for deciding whether or not a given system can
be produced from a given set of component processors
