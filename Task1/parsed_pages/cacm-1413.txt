a vision of technology and education

educational technology is currently quite
fashionable  here as in many other branches or 
aspects of technology changes possible in the next generation
or two are now known as ideas discoveries 
or inventions  the unknown is whether the potential
will become the actual and if so on what time 
scale  this ignorance stems largely from ignorance about
the social response to potential technological 
change  the object of this paper is to present a vision
of potential educational technology and to raise 
questions about the modes of social response and
adaptation likely to be evoked by such a vision
