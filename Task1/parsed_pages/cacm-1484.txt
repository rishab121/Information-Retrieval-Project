a language for describing the functions of synchronous systems 

before the design of a system is started the
exact function desired of it should be specified 
 it is suggested that a computer-oriented language be
used for this purpose  the inadequacies of the 
standard programming languages for the description of
systems are discussed and a dialect of algol which 
is suitable for describing synchronous systems is introduced
 these descriptions can be used for simulation 
and automatic design of the system described in
addition to communicating system specifications
