on the feasibility of voice input to
an on-line computer processing system

an on-line digital computer processing system is considered in which an 
ordinary telephone is the complete terminal device input to the computer 
being provided as a sequence of spoken words and output to the user being 
audio responses from the machine  the feasibility of implementing such a 
system with a fortran-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is 
considered  details of a specific word recognition program are given  this 
technique depends on three simplifying restrictions namely a small
vocabulary set known speakers and a moment of silence
between each input word  experimental results are presented giving
error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine 
resources required to accommodate several users at a time the results show 
that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at 
least 40 users at a time with an ibm 360/65 computer
