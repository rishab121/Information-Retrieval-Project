menu planning by computer

a computer code has been developed which plans
menus by finding minimum cost combinations of 
menu items such that the daily dietary gastronomic
and production requirements can be satisfied for 
a sequence of days  a fast special integer programming
algorithm is described which approximates the 
theoretical solution to the problem  if necessary any
menu can be changed on-line and then post-optimized 
 up to 30 percent saving on food cost is possible 
a fortran program for the ibm 1410 is available on 
request  a considerable amount of data processing
must precede the implementation of the system
