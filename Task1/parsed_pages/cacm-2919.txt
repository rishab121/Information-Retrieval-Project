the programmers workbench-a machine for software development

on almost all software development projects the
assumption is made that the program development 
function will be done on the same machine on which the
eventual system will run  it is only when this 
production machine is unavailable or when its programming
environment is totally inadequate that alternatives 
are considered  in this paper it is suggested that
there are many other situations where it would be 
advantageous to separate the program development and
main tenance function onto a specialized computer 
which is dedicated to that purpose  such a computer
is here called a programmers workbench  the four 
basic sections of the paper in troduce the subjectoutline
the general concept discuss areas where such 
an approach may prove beneficial and describe
an operational system utilizing this concept
