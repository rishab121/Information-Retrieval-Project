an interactive command generating facility

a facility to permit conversationally controlled tasks
to be executed in a noninteractive environment is proposed
a means by which programs can generate interactive time-sharing commands
and receive the corresponding output response is presented  the commands 
will be invoked as if they had been typed at a console keyboard  it is 
argued that this facility will help overcome some of the current limitations 
in man-computer communication a set of functions to accomplish the above 
which could be embedded into any string processing language is suggested 
and necessary information pertinent to implementation of the facility on 
existing time-sharing systems is given
