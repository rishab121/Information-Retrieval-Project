spline function methods for nonlinear boundary-value problems

the solution of the nonlinear differential equation
yfxyy with two-point boundary conditions 
is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function
yx  the method is well suited to nonuniform 
mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation  for uniform
mesh size h the error in the quintic spline 
yx is oh^4 with typical error one-third that from
numerovs method  requiring the differential 
equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results
in a set of difference equations which are block 
tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods
