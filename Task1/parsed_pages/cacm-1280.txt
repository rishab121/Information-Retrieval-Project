numerical integration of a differential-difference
equation with a decreasing time-lag

systems in which variable time-lags are present
are of common occurrence in biology  variable 
flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags
 at present no extensive body of knowledge exists 
concerning the effects which these variable lags can
cause  shown here is a method of reducing some 
differential-difference equations to ordinary differential
equations which can then be studied numerically 
with ease  subsequent study will deal with situations
in which multiple-lags and lags dependent on the 
solution itself are present
