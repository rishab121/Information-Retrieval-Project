general performance analysis of key-to-address
transformation methods using an abstract file 
concept

this paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods  in this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm  all files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods  using this analysis methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified
 all this can be done analytically  the approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly
