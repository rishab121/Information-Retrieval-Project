symbolic factoring of polynomials in several variables

an algorithm for finding the symbolic factors of
a multi-variate polynomial with integer coefficients 
is presented  the algorithm is an extension of a technique
used by kronecker in a proof that the prime 
factoring of any polynomial may be found in a finite number
of steps  the algorithm consists of factoring 
single-variable instances of the given polynomial by
kroneckers method and introducing the remaining 
variables by interpolation  techniques for implementing the
algorithm and several examples are discussed 
 the algorithm promises sufficient power to be used efficiently
in an online system for symbolic mathematics
