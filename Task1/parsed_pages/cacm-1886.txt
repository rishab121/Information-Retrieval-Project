generation of optimal code for expressions via factorization

given a set of expressions which are to be
compiled methods are presented for increasing the 
efficiency of the object code produced by first factoring
the expressions ie finding a set of subexpressions 
each of which occurs in two or more other expressions
or subexpressions  once all the factors have been 
ascertained a sequencing procedure is applied which
orders the factors and expressions such that all 
information is computed in the correct sequence and factors
need be retained in memory a minimal amount 
of time  an assignment algorithm is then executed in
order to minimize the total number of temporary 
storage cells required to hold the results of evaluating
the factors  in order to make these techniques 
computationally feasible heuristic procedures are
applied and hence global optimal results are not 
necessarily generated  the factorization algorithms
are also applicable to the problem of factoring 
boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomials
encountered in symbol manipulating systems
