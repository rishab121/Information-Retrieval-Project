polynomial and spline approximation by quadratic programming

the problem of approximation to a given function
or of fitting a given set of data where 
the approximating function is required to have certain
of its derivations of specified sign over the 
whole range of approximation is studied  two approaches
are presented in each of which quadratic programming 
is used to provide both the constraints on the derivatives
and the selection of the function which yields 
the best fit  the first is a modified bernstein polynomial
scheme and the second is a spline fit
