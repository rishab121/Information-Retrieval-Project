a base for a mobile programming system

an algorithm for a macro processor which has
been used as the base of an implementation by 
bootstrapping of processors for programming languages is
described  this algorithm can be easily implemented 
on contemporary computing machines  experience with
programming languages whose implementation is based
on this algorithm indicates that such a language can
be transferred to a new machine in less than one 
man-week without using the old machine
