on the capabilities of while repeat and exit statements

a well-formed program is defined as a program
in which loops and if statements are properly 
nested and can be entered only at their beginning  a
corresponding definition is given for a well-formed 
flowchart  it is shown that a program is well formed if
and only if it can be written with if repeat 
and multi-level exit statements for sequence control 
it is also shown that ifwhile and repeat statements 
with single-level exit do not suffice  it is also shown
that any flowcharts can be converted to a well-formed 
flowchart by node splitting  practical implications are discussed
