information theory applied to the conversion
of decision tables to computer programs

using ideas from information theory this paper
develops a heuristic algorithm that converts 
a limited entry decision table to a tree structured computer
program with near minimum average processing 
time  the method is applicable to any limited entry
decision table and does not require that actions 
have single rules or that the cost of testing conditions
be equal  it is thus more general than the 
previously published heuristic algorithms  compared
to the optimal algorithm of reinwald and soland 
this algorithm is easy to code and takes a much smaller
translation time it is thus felt that it is 
more useful in practice  the algorithm is well suited for
manual conversion of decision tables to flowcharts
