a nonrecursive method of syntax specification

the use of the kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax 
in particular of algol is described in this paper 
a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of gornsimilar to gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations 
is described  this was applied to numerous smaller
languages including some sublanguage of algol  
a hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of algol is given thus expressing 
the revised algol 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned  this description in many ways is far more
intuitively understood than the previous recursive 
description it is suggested  the paper also includes
results of the machine program which does not 
include a simplification algorithm
