register allocation via usage counts

this paper introduces the notion of usage counts
shows how usage counts can be developed by 
algorithms that eliminate redundant computations and
describes how usage counts can provide the basis 
for register allocation  the paper compares register
allocation based on usage counts to other commonly 
used register allocation techniques and presents evidence
which shows that the usage count technique 
is significantly better than these other techniques
