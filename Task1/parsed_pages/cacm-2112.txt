translation equations

input limited transduction expressions or translation equations
are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for 
context-free languages  a formal procedure is given for deriving from
a set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator
the translator consists of mealy form finite-state automata interacting
by means of a pushdown stack  within the framework described string 
recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation 
problem
