storing a sparse table

the problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in 
computer science  the standard technique for storing such tables is
hashing but hashing has poor worst-case performance  we propose
a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries
each an integer between 0 and n  1  the method requires 0n w
words of storage and allows ologn n access time  although our method
is a little complicated to use in practice our analysis shows
why a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well
