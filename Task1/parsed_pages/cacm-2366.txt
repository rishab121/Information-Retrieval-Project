complex gamma function with error control

an algorithm to compute the gamma function and
log gamma function of a complex variable is presented 
 the standard algorithm is modified in several respects
to insure the continuity of the function value 
and to reduce accumulation of round-off errors  in
addition to computation of function values this 
algorithm includes an object-time estimation of round-off
errors  experimental data with regard to the 
effectiveness of this error control are presented 
a fortran program for the algorithm appears in the 
algorithms section of this issue
