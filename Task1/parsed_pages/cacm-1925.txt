concepts of use in contour map processing

generalized techniques whose use can simplify
the solution of problems relating to contour 
maps  one of these techniques makes use of the topological
properties of contour maps  the topology 
is represented by a graphical structure in which adjacent
contour lines appear as connected nodes  another 
generalized technique consists of utilizing geometrical
properties to determine the characteristics of 
straight lines drawn on the contour map  both of these
techniques have been applied to the problem of 
locating the ground track of an aircraft from
elevation readings obtained during a flight
