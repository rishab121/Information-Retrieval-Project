on the complexity of lrk testing

the problem of determining whether an arbitrary
context-free grammar is a member of some easily 
parsed subclass of grammars such as the lrk grammars
is considered  the time complexity of this problem 
is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed
integer and when k is considered to be a parameter 
of the test  in the first case it is shown that for
every k there exists an onk+2 algorithm for 
testing the lrk property where n is the size of the
grammar in question  on the other hand if both 
k and the subject grammar are problem parameters then
the complexity of the problem depends very strongly 
on the representation chosen for k  more specifically
it is shown that this problem is np-complete 
when k is expressed in unary  when k is expressed in
binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic 
exponential time  these results carry over to many
other parameterized classes of grammars such as 
the llk strong llk slrk lck and strong lck grammars
