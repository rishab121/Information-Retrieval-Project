a comparison of numerical techniques in markov modeling

this paper presents several numerical methods which
may be used to obtain the stationary probability 
vectors of markovian models  an example of a nearly
decomposable system is considered and the results 
obtained by the different methods examined  a post
mortem reveals why standard techniques often fail 
to yield the correct results  finally a means of estimating
the error inherent in the decomposition 
of certain models is presented
