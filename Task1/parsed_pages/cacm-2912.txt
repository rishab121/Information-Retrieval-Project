concurrent reading and writing

the problem of sharing data among asynchronous
process is considered  it is assumed that only 
one process at a time can modify the data but concurrent
reading and writing is permitted  two general 
theorems are proved and some algorithms are presented
to illustrate their use  these include a solution 
to the general problem in which a read is repeated if
it might have obtained an incorrect result and 
two techniques for transmitting messages between processes
 these solutions do not assume any synchronizing 
mechanism other than data which can be written
by one process and read by other processes
