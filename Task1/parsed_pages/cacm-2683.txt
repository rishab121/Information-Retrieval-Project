the synthesis of loop predicates

current methods for mechanical program verification
require a complete predicate specification 
on each loop  because this is tedious and error prone
producing a program with complete correct predicates 
is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine
assistance  this paper discusses techniques 
for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates  two classes
of techniques are considered 1 heuristic 
methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditions
and/or partially specified inductive assertions 
2 extraction methods which use input predicates and
appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain 
classes of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation
