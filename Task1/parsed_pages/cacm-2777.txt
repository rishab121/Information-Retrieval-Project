on a solution to the cigarette smokers
problem without conditional statements

this report discusses a problem first introduced
by patil who has claimed that the cigarette 
smokers problem cannot be solved using the p and v operations
introduced by dijkstra unless conditional 
statements are used  an examination of patils proof
shows that he has established this claim only under 
strong restrictions on the use of p and v  these restrictions
eliminate programming techniques used 
by dijkstra and others since the first introduction
of the semaphore concept  this paper contains a 
solution to the problem  it also discusses the need
for the generalized operators suggested by patil
