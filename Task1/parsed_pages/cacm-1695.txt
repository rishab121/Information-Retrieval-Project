plexus-an on-line system for modeling neural networks

a description is presented of plexus a system
which enables a user to construct and specify 
a neural network to analyze the output data produced
by the network and to store and retrieve networks 
and data from a library  the system operated entirely
from a digital display unit interacts directly 
with the user and permits easy and rapid transitions
between the various phases of the modeling process 
 plexus is designed to complement neurophysiological research
so that the systematic development of neural 
models can be coordinated with experimental work  plexus
networks are built up from components representing 
individual neurons external stimuli and interconnecting
fibers each component being of a relatively 
detailed nature  provision is also made for the use of
experimental data as input to a network  convenient 
means for specification and modification of a network and
extensive error-checking capabilities are provided 
data resulting from the simulation of a network may be
analyzed by a variety of techniques ranging from 
examinations of the gross characteristics of the data to
the determination of detailed statistical properties
