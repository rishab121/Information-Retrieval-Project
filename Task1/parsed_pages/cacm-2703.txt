the intrinsically exponential complexity of
the circularity problem for attribute grammars

attribute grammars are an extension of context-free
grammars devised by knuth as a mechanism 
for including the semantics of a context-free language
with the syntax of the language  the circularity 
problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics
for all possible sentences programs in 
fact will be well defined  it is proved that this problem
is in general computationally intractable 
 specifically it is shown that any deterministic algorithm
which solves the problem must for infinitely 
many cases use an exponential amount of timen improved
version of knuths circularity testing algorithm 
is also given which actually solves the problem within exponential time
