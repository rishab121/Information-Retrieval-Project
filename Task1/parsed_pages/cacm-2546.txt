the use of grammatical inference for designing programming languages

both in designing a new programming language
and in extending an existing language the designer 
is faced with the problem of deriving a natural grammar
for the language  we are proposing an interactive 
approach to the grammar design problem wherein the designer
presents a sample of sentences and structures 
as input to a grammatical inference algorithm  the algorithm
then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable 
generalization of the examples submitted by the designer
 the implementation is presently restricted 
to a subclass of operator precedence grammars but
a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a 
larger class of context-free grammars
