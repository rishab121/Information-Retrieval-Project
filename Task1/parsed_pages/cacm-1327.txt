use of decision tables in computer programming

a decision table is a tabular form for displaying
decision logic  decision tables have many 
inherent advantages  the technique to be illustrated
puts these advantages to use in that it enables 
one to program directly from a decision table  the technique
is based on the creation of a binary image 
of a limited entry decision table in computer memory
 a binary image of a given set of input conditions 
can also be created  this data image is used to scan
the decision table image to arrive at the proper 
course of action  there are several advantages gained
from the programming point view 1 amount of 
computer memory used is drastically reduced 2 programming
is simplified and 3 documentation is 
brief and clear
