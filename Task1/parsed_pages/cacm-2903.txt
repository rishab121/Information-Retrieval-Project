improving programs by the introduction of recursion

a new technique of program transformation
called recursion in troduction is described and 
applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems
 by using recursion in troduction algorithms 
which manipulate a stack are first translated into
recursive algorithms in which no stack operations 
occur  these algorithms are then subjected to a second
transformation a method of recursion elimination 
called tabulation to produce programs with a very
efficient running time  in particular it is shown 
how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of knuth
morris and pratt can be derived in a few steps 
from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm
