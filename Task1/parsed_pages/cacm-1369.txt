half rotations in n-dimensional euclidean space

an iterative procedure is described for determining
half rotations in n-dimensional euclidean 
space the method is a variant of the cyclic jacobi
procedure and utilizers elementary plane rotations 
to obtain the half rotation matrix  numerical examples are given
