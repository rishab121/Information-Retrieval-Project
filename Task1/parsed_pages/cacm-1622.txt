an efficient procedure for the generation of closed subsets

an efficient algorithm is described for generating
subsets of a set s which satisfy constraints 
of the form if si is a member of the subset then
sj must also be a member of the subset  the 
algorithm has been programmed in the wisp language and
successfully run on the ibm 7094 in connection 
with a routine to detect feedback in multidimensional iterative networks
