increasing the efficiency of quicksort

a method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations of
quicksort  the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown
 to be an log^2n  a formula is derived expressing a in terms of
the probability distribution of the bound of a partition  this
 formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization already
considered by hoare namely choice of the bound as median
of a random sample the main contribution of this paper is another
generalization of quicksort which uses a bounding interval instead
of a single element as bound  this generalization turns out to
be easy to implement in a computer program  a numerical approximation
shows that a  1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with
1.386 for the original  this implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 
18 percent actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time
