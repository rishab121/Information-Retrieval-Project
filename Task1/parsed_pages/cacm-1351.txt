automatic error bounds on real zeros of rational functions

a procedure for implementing an interval arithmetic
version of the newton-raphson method is 
proposed  the procedure require only a starting interval
over which the zeros of a given rational function 
are to be located  the method automatically provides bounds 
for roundoff error
