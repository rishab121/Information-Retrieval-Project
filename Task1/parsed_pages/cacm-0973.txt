estimation of heart parameters using skin potential measurements

a fundamental problem of vector cardiography
is the estimation of the state of the heart on 
the basis of skin potential measurements  a mathematical
model relating ventricular dipoles to surface 
potentials is sketched  then it is shown that the inverse
problem-that of determining electrical heart 
parameters on the basis of skin potential measurements-may
be viewed as a nonlinear multipoint boundary 
value problem  a feasible solution employing quasilinearization
and high-speed digital computers is 
given
