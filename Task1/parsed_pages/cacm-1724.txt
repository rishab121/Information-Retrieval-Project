a generalized partial pass block sort

the design of a partial pass block sort with
arbitrary range of key and number of work files 
is described the design is a generalization of the partial
pass column sort by ashenhurst and the amphisbaenic 
sort by nagler the power of the sort is tabulated for
various sizes of input file and number of work 
files consideration is given to the problem of combining
a block sort with internal sorts and to the 
best use of direct access storage devices
