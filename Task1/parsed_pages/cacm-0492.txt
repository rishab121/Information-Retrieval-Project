analysis of a file addressing method

this paper presents a new file addressing method
based on the calculation of an address from 
the identification of a record  for large recirculating
type files it seems to be more advantageous 
than customary ones  the probability distribution of
the displacement of records from their calculated 
address which is one less than the number of probes
required to address a record is computed on the 
basis of a markov chain model  for the reader not interested
in the mathematics the introduction and 
the summary should be sufficient
