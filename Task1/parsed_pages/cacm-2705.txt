programming languages natural languages and mathematics

some social aspects of programming are illuminated
through analogies with similar aspects of 
mathematics and natural languages  the split between
pure and applied mathematics is found similarly 
in programming the development of natural languages toward
flexion less word-order based language types 
speaks for programming language design based on general
abstract constructs  by analogy with incidents 
of the history of artificial auxiliary languages it
is suggested that fortran and cobol will remain 
dominant for a long time to come  the most promising
avenues for further work of wide influence are 
seen to be high quality program literature ie programs
of general utility and studies of questions 
related to program style
