significance arithmetic on a digital computer

the 7090 at nyu has been modified to include
a significance mode of operation which is intended 
to facilitate the identification of significant bits in
the results of floating-point arithmetic operations 
 the manner in which floating-point arithmetic is handled
in this mode is discussed  several numerical 
experiments using this mode are described and comparisons
are made with the ordinary normalized mode 
 examples include power series evaluation linear equations
solution determinant evaluation and matrix 
inversion
