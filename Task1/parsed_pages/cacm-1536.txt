dynamic computation of derivatives

it is shown how wengerts procedure for computation
of derivatives can be implemented conveniently 
by use of compiler-generated complex addition subtraction
and linkage to complex arithmetic subroutines
 evaluation of a function and derivative proceed in
parallel as in wengerts procedure but with the 
imaginary parts of variables declared complex bearing
the values of the derivatives of the real parts 
 this technique provides a simple way to compute the
derivatives of a function without the need for 
deriving and programming the evaluation of
explicit formulas for the derivatives
