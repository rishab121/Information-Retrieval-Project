dynamic microprogramming processor organization and programming

a dynamically microprogrammed processor is characterized
by a small 4^k 64-bit word read-write 
micro storage  the access time of this storage is
similar to the cycle time of the machine 50-100 
nsec  this microstorage is used to contain both data
and subroutines  the micro instructions in 
such a processor differ from the conventional in that
they perform only purely combinatorial operations 
sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction
the presence of the read-write microstorage 
permits a more flexible assignment of resources than the
read-only storage  in particular the processor 
developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation
within the microinstruction of the adder 
shifter masker and testing facilities of the processor
 a microassembly language is developed and 
the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed
 the efficiency of a flexible software linkage 
scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutine
characteristics  finally three examples 
of problem-oriented programming are considered and the
resulting coding is compared against a system/360 
assembly language version with the technology normalized
