a vector space model for automatic indexing

in a document retrieval or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities documents 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
search requests it appears that the best indexing 
property space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space 
in particular retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density  an approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents 
 typical evaluation results are shown demonstrating
the usefulness of the model
