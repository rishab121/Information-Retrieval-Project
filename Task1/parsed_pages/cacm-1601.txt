parallel numerical methods for the solution of equations

classical iterative procedures for the numerical
solution of equations provide at each stage 
a single new approximation to the root in question  a
technique is given for the development of numerical 
procedures which provide at each stage several approximations
to a solution of an equation  the s8everal 
approximations obtained in any iteration are computationally
independent making the methods of interest 
in a parallel processing environment  convergence is
insured by extracting the best information at 
each iteration  several families of numerical procedures
which use the technique of the procedures in 
a parallel processing environment are developed and measurements
of these statistics are reported  these 
measurements are interpreted in a parallel processing
environment  in such an environment the procedures 
obtained are superior to standard algorithms
