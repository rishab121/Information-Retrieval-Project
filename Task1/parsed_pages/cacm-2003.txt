an interactive software system for computers-aided
design  an application to circuit project

the characteristics of an interactive software system intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process are presented  the main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages operating at different levels on which the interaction
is based  the first one is imol an interactive monitor language
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design  the second one is 
coif a circuit oriented graphic language which is designed
to describe generate and manipulate graphic problem specifications 
it is an  extension of fortran with graphic-type variables
so that the designer who is familiar with fortran need not learn a new 
language  the application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined on the other hand the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications
