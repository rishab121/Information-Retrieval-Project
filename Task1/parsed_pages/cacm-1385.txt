computer technology in communist china 1956-1965

based on information from translations of communist
chinese news items and periodical literature 
for the 1965 period computer technology in china is
reviewed under the following headings 1 initial 
planning organization and educational aspects of computer
technology and automation 2 machine development 
progress two major specific machines in 1958-59 with
soviet aid a vacuum in 1960-64 due to the withdrawal 
of soviet aid then presumably all-chinese-made machines
from 1965 to the present 3 computer applications 
4 the trend of automation control of production processes
rather than data processing and 5 the 
yun chou hsueh science of operation and programming
campaign of 1958-60 during which an attempt 
was made to bring concepts such as linear programming
to ordinary chinese workers and peasants  communist 
china is adjudged to have a marginal computer capability
with most of its machines probably being of 
a binary nature however a turning point may have been reached in mid-1965
