an analysis of some time-sharing techniques

the effectiveness of certain time-sharing techniques
such as program relocation disk rotational 
delay minimization and swap volume minimization is
investigated  summary data is presented and the 
findings are discussed  the vehicle for this investigation
was a simula based simulation model reflecting 
an early framework for a planned burroughs b6500 time-sharing
system  inasmuch as the b6500 system is 
based upon the use of variable sized segments and a
dynamic overlay procedure data is also presented 
which provides some indication of the effectiveness of this
type of organization in a time-sharing environment 
 the design characteristics and operational capabilities
of the simulation model are also described
