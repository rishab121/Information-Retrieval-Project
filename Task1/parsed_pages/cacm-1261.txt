modeling and simulation of digital networks

the simulation of digital networks on a digital
computer provides the engineer with an effective 
means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior  the
digital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent 
or time-independent boolean transformations each transformation
describing the input-output relationship 
of a model element comprising the network mode  the
simplicity of utilizing the fortran iv programming 
system as a digital network simulator is discussed an
illustrated  this simplicity is derived from a 
common modeling technique applicable to combinational
and sequential digital networks and a systematic 
programming approach
