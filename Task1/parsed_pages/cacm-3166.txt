computing standard deviations accuracy

four algorithms for the numerical computation
of the standard deviation of unweighted sampled data
are analyzed  two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical
and computational literature the other two are new algorithms
specifically intended for automatic computation  our discussion is 
expository with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of
accuracy  each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions
under which it will be accurate  we conclude that all four
algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems but two
of the algorithms one new one old are substantially more accurate
on difficult problems than are the other two
