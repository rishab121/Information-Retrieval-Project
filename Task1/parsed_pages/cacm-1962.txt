groove-a program to compose store and edit functions of time

a program which makes possible creating storing reproducing
and editing functions of time is described  the functions are typical
of those generated by human beings  multiple functions up to 14
are produced for long periods of time up to several hours at
sufficiently high sampling rates to describe fast human reactions
up to 200 samples per second  the functions can be used for a
variety of purposes such as the control of machine tools or sound
synthesizers or anything a person normally controls  the program
operates on a small computer ddp-224  functions are stored on a
disk file  functions may be created by real-time human inputs to
the computer which can interact with already stored functions and
computed functions  real-time feedback from the process being
controlled is an important link in the system  the environment for
effective man-machine interaction has been carefully nurtured
