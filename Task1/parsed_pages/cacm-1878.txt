recovery of reentrant list structures in slip

one consequence of the reference-count-based
space-recovery system employed by slip is that 
reentrant list structures are not recovered even when
explicitly erased  lisp-like garbage-collection 
schemes are free of this impediment  they however
depend on being able to find and mark nodes that 
are reachable from program variables  by tracing all
descendants from program variables may then be 
identified and collected  the list-creating function
list of slip may be amended to mark those lists 
for which the programmer wishes to assume responsibility
 given this modification a lisp-like garbage 
collector that recovers abandoned reentrant list structures
may then be appended to the slip system
