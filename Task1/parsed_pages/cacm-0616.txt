an information algebra  phase i report-language
structure group of the codasyl development committee

this report represents the results of the
first phase of the work of the language structure 
group  the goal of this work is to arrive at a proper
structure for a machine-independent problem-defining 
language at the systems level of data processing  the
report is based for the most part on a mathematical 
model called an information algebra developed primarily
by r bosak  it is hoped that this report 
will be read a with avid interest by programming language
designers and implementors and all those 
interested in developing a theoretical approach to data
processing b with interest and understanding 
by professional programmers and systems analysts and c
with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager 
 the authors have not attempted an exhaustive discourse
in this report  rather they have tried to present 
a philosophy to the professional people who are vitally
concerned with providing a working language for 
the systems analysts use  they trust that the ideas
in this report will stimulate others to think along 
similar lines  questions and comments will be welcomed
and can be addressed to any of the members of 
the language structure group  robert bosak system
