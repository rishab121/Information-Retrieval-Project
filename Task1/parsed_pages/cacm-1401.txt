quasilinearization and the calculation of eigenvalues

several eigenvalue problems for systems of
ordinary differential equations are considered 
 they are resolved computationally using the quasilinerization
technique a quadratically convergent 
successive approximation scheme related to
the newton-raphson-kantorovich method
