a system organization for resource allocation 

this paper introduces a system for resource management
using the concepts of process facility 
and event  except for the processor no attempt has
been made to give serious suggestions for the policy 
to be followed for resource allocation  however a basic
framework is provided in which a system analyst 
can express solutions to resource management problems
 the paper is divided into a tutorial presentation 
a description of the system primitives and a small collection
of examples of the use of the primitives
