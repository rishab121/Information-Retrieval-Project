analysis of an algorithm for real time garbage collection

a real time garbage collection system avoids
suspending the operations of a list processor 
for the long times that garbage collection normally requires
by performing garbage collection on a second 
processor in parallel with list processing operations
or on a single processor time-shared with them 
 algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in
this manner are presented and analyzed to determine 
sufficient conditions under which the list processor never
needs to wait on the collector  these techniques 
are shown to require at most twice as much processing
power as regular garbage collectors if they are 
used efficiently  the average behavior of the program
is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case 
performance so that the sufficient conditions are also
suitable for measuring the typical behavior of 
the algorithm
