implementation of the substring test by hashing

a technique is described for implementing the
test which determines if one string is a substring 
of another  when there is low probability that the test
will be satisfied it is shown how the operation 
can be speeded up considerably if it is preceded by
a test on appropriately chosen hash codes of the 
strings
