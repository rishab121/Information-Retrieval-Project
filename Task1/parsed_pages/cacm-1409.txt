nebula a digital computer using a 20 mc glass delay line memory

oregon state university has designed and constructed
a medium-speed serial digital computer 
using glass delay lines circulating at 22 mc as memory
 the design objectives as originally conceived 
in a special seminar were 1 to be a research project
in computer design 2 to be usable as an educational 
machineand 3 to have easily modifiable hardware for
basic research in computer systems design  an 
unusual arrangement of information within the 22 mc
memory allows a simple interface with the 340 kc 
arithmetic unit which results in an effective zero latency
time and provides possibilities for an associative 
memory  the arithmetic unit has a command structure similar
to large parallel machines and uses flip-flop 
arithmetic and control registers throughout  all hardware
development has been aimed toward the concept 
of easy modification elaborate console controls for
effective man-machine interaction and low cost
