optimal starting values for newton-raphson calculation of sqrtx

the problem of obtaining starting values for
the newton-raphson calculation of sqrtx on a 
digital computer is considered  it is shown that the
conventionally used best uniform approximations 
to sqrtx do not provide optimal starting values 
the problem of obtaining optimal starting values 
 the problem of obtaining optimal starting values is
stated and several basic results are proved  a 
table of optimal polynomial starting values is given
