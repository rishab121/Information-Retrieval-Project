gauss harmonic interpolation formulas

let r be an open bounded simply connected
region in the xy-plane and let xy be a 
point in r  assuming r is starlike with respect to
xy we discuss a method for computing gauss 
harmonic interpolation formulas for r and the point xy
 such formulas approximate a harmonic function 
at xy in terms of a linear combination of its
values at certain selected points on the boundary 
of r  such formulas are useful for approximating
the solution of the dirichlet problem for r
