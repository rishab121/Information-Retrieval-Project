design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for pl/i

pl/c is a compiler for a dialect for pl/i  the
design objective was to provide a maximum degree 
of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment
 for the most part this assistance is implicit 
and is provided automatically by the compiler the most remarkable
characteristic of pl/c is its perseverance-it 
completes translation of every program submitted and
continues execution until a user-established error 
limit is reached this requires that the compiler repair
errors encountered during both translation 
and execution and the design of pl/c is dominated by
this consideration  pl/c also introduces several 
explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing
 to accommodate these extensions to pl/i without 
abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl/c permits
pseudo comments-constructions whose contents 
can optionally be considered either source test or comment
 in spite of the diagnostic effort pl/c is 
a fast and efficient processor  it effectively demonstrates
that compilers can provide better diagnostic 
assistance than is customarily offered even when a sophisticated
source language is employed and that 
this assistance need not be prohibitively costly
