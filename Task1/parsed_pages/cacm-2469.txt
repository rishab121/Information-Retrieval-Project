petri nets and speed independent design

petri nets are investigated as one method of
modeling speed independent asynchronous circuits 
 a study of circuit realizations of petri nets leads
to a demonstration of their usefulness in modeling 
speed independent operation  this usefulness is emphasized
by the design of a speed independent processor 
from modules developed in the investigation of petri net implementation
