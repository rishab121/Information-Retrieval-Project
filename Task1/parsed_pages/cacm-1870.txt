some techniques for using pseudorandom numbers in computer simulation

an algorithm is described by which uniform pseudorandom
integers may be used to construct binary 
numbers in which the probability that each bit in the
word is a 1-bit and can assume any desired parameter 
value  techniques for making use of such numbers
in simulation programming are described
