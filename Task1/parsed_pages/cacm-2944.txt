shifting garbage collection overhead to compile time

this paper discusses techniques which enable automatic
storage reclamation overhead to be partially 
shifted to compile time  the paper assumes a transaction
oriented collection scheme as proposed by 
deutsch and bobrow the necessary features of which are
summarized  implementing the described optimizations 
requires global flow analysis to be performed on the
source program  it is shown that at compile time 
certain program actions that affect the reference counts
of cells can be deduced  this information is 
used to find actions that cancel when the code is executed
and those that can be grouped to achieve improved 
efficiency
