numerical integration of function that has a pole

it is common to need to integrate numerically
functions that diverge somewhere outside the 
range of integration  even if the divergence occurs quite
far away integration formulas like simpsons 
that depend on fitting a polynomial usually will be
inaccurate near a pole they will be very bad  
a method is described that gives formulas that will integrate
functions of this kind accurately if the 
orders and positions of the poles are known  explicit
formulas are given that are easy to use on an 
automatic computer  it is shown that they can be used
for some other singularities as well as poles 
 if the integral converges integration can be carried
to the singularity  the accuracy of the integration 
with a pole of second order is discussed and as an example
the new formula is compared with simpsons 
 the new formulas are useful even far from the pole
while near the pole their advantage is overwhelming
