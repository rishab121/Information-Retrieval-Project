a large semaphore based operating system

the paper describes the internal structure of
a large operating system as a set of cooperating 
sequential processes  the processes synchronize by
means of semaphores and extended semaphores queue 
semaphores  the number of parallel processes is carefully
justified and the various semaphore constructions 
are explained  the system is proved to be free of deadly
embrace deadlock  the design principle 
is an alternative to dijkstras hierarchical structuring
of operating systems  the project management 
and the performance are discussed too  the operating
system is the first large one using the rc 4000 
multiprogramming system
