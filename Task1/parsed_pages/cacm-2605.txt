a description is given of a program for computing
the solution to a small number of standard 
numerical analysis problems to any specified accuracy
up to a limit of 2000 correct decimal places 
 each computed number is bounded in an interval with a

involving these numbers are executed according to interval
arithmetic concepts with non-significant
