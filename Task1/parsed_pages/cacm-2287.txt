a new approach to automatic scanning of contour maps

the problem of automatic digitizing of contour
maps is discussed  the structure of a general 
contour map is analyzed and its topological properties
are utilized in developing a new scanning algorithm 
 the problem of detection and recognition of contour
lines is solved by a two color labeling method 
 it is shown that for maps containing normal contour lines
only it suffices to distinguish between so-called 
even and odd lines  the tangency problem involved
in practical scanning is discussed and a solution 
based on minimizing computer memory space and
simplifying control program is suggested
