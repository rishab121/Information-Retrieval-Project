a comparison of hardware and software associative
memories in the context of computer graphics

the associative processing of line drawings apld
system utilizes a hardware associative memory 
and creates modifies deletes stores and retrieves
two-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts
lines rectangles and triangles the apld functions
were duplicated on the tx-2 computer at ms 
lincoln laboratory under the leap language and data
structure  a comparison of the hardware approach 
with the software simulation illustrates the advantages
of the hardware associative memory in three areas 
1 processing speed 2 storage requirements and 3
flexibility  the major problem areas of hardware 
associative memory technology namely input/output
and cost effectiveness are also addressed
