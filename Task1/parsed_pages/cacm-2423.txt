a parser-generating system for constructing compressed compilers

this paper describes a parser-generating system
pgs currently in use on the cdc-6500 computer 
at purdue university  the pgs is a fortran-coded compiler
 in the input translation grammar each bnf 
syntactic rule corresponds to a possibly empty code
generator realizable as an assembly language 
fortran or algol subroutine that is called whenever
that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a 
program  typical one-pass compilers constructed by the
pgs translate source programs at speeds approaching 
14,000 cards per minute  for an xpl compiler the parser
program and its tables currently occupy 288 
words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing
table entries and 82 words are links to code 
generators
