a unifying computational method for the
analysis of complete factorial experiments

a computational method which may be used for
the calculation of sums of squares in the analysis 
of variance of complete factorial experiments and in
the computation of main effect or interaction means 
is described  the method is elucidated as unifying since
one method can be used for a variety of purposes 
each previously requiring different methods  the programming
advantages of such a method are obvious 
 the following variants are discussed 1 the standard
analysis of variance 2 analyses omitting certain 
levels of one or more factors 3 separate analyses
for some levels of a factor or for combinations 
of levels of more than one factor  these are performed
simultaneously 4 the calculation of main effect 
or interaction means  the mean expects the data in standard
order and it leaves the data in that order 
so that many analyses of the same data can be performed
without rearrangement  the total sum of squares 
excluding a replication sum of squares is partitioned
into all polynomial partitions and their interactions 
each with one degree of freedom  this is so even
if factors have unequally spaced factor levels
