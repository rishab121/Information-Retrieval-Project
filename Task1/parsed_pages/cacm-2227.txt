proof of a program find

a proof is given of the correctness of the
algorithm find  first a informal description 
is given of the purpose of the program and the method
used  a systematic technique is described for 
constructing the program proof during the process of coding
it in such a way as to prevent the intrusion 
of logical errors  the proof of termination is treated
as a separate exercise  finally some conclusions 
relating to general programming methodology are drawn
