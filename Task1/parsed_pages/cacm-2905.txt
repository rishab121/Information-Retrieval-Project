perfect hashing functions a single
probe retrieving method for static sets

a refinement of hashing which allows retrieval
of an item in a static table with a single probe 
is considered  given a set i of identifiers two methods
are presented for building in a mechanical 
way perfect hashing functions ie functions transforming
the elements of i into unique addresses 
 the first method the quotient reduction method is
shown to be complete in the sense that for every 
set i the smallest table in which the elements of i
can be stored and from which they can be retrieved 
by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this
method can be found  however for nonuniformly 
distributed sets this method can give rather sparse tables
 the second method the remainder reduction 
method is not complete in the above sense but it seems
to give minimal or almost minimal tables for 
every kind of set  the two techniques are applicable
directly to small sets  some methods to extend 
these results to larger sets are also presented  a rough
comparison with ordinary hashing is given which 
shows that this method can be used conveniently
in several practical applications
