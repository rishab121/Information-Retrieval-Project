graph coloring conditions for the existence
of solutions to the timetable problem

a necessary and sufficient condition is presented
for the existence of a solution to the gotlieb 
class-teacher timetable problem  several relationships
are established between the class-teacher timetable 
problem and graphs with preconditions  these preconditions
place additional restrictions on the coloration 
of a graph  the preconditions correspond to the unavailability
constraints and preassigned meetings 
in the class-teacher timetable problem  using some recent
results that convert graphs with preconditions 
to graphs without them it is shown that the existence
of a coloration of a graph is the required necessary 
and sufficient condition
