boolean matrix methods for the detection of simple precedence grammars

a mechanical procedure is derived for determining
whether a given context-free phrase structure 
grammar is a simple precedence grammar  this procedure
consists of elementary operations on suitably 
defined boolean matrices  application of the
procedure to operator grammars is also given
