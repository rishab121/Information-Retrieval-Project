computer simulation of city traffic

in simulating traffic flow on city streets
the national bureau of standards has used data 
processing techniques to tabulate and make motion pictures
of vehicle movements in the model  each vehicle 
is assigned a digital identification giving points of
entry and exit type of vehicle desired speed 
and actual speed in proportions simulating field data
 changes in the model can be made to observe 
their consequences and to determine the ability of a
real street to carry loads expected in the future
