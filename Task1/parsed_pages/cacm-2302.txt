computers and employment

the relationship of computers and automation
to employment is part of the more general relation 
of technological change to employment  the most obvious
effect is that increase in productivity due 
to technology can eliminate jobs  technology affects
the individual worker in the nature and amount 
of his work and in his attitudes toward that work  technological
change affects the occupational structure 
of the entire labor force  because of the central importance
of these effects the impact of technology 
has been the subject of extensive study by economists sociologists
political scientists and psychologists 
 even within a single discipline studies are often contradictory
and conclusions are colored by political 
overtones  we wish to delineate some of the issues
and present arguments given to support different 
viewpoints
