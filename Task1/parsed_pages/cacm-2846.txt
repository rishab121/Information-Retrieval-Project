compressed tries

this paper presents a new data structure
called a compressed trie or c-trie to be used in 
information retrieval systems  it has the same underlying
m-ary tree structure as a trie where m is 
a parameter of the trie but whereas the fields of the
nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
a key or at least a pointer the fields in a c-trie are
only one bit long  in the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key is of the order logmn and the storage
requirement of the order nm+log2 n bits  this 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure and therefore updating costs are increased
 first the c-trie is analyzed as a data 
structure and then several methods of its use
for relatively static databases are discussed
