implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature i methodology and experience

clenshaw-curtis quadrature is a particularly
important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety 
of reasons especially the high accuracy obtained from
relatively few integrand values  however it 
has received little use because it requires the computation
of a cosine transformation and the arithmetic 
cost of this has been prohibitive  this paper is in
two parts a companion paper ii computing the 
cosine transformation shows that this objection can
be overcome by computing the cosine transformation 
by a modification of the fast fourier transform algorithm
 this first part discusses the strategy and 
various error estimates and summarizes experience
with a particular implementation of the scheme
