an empirical study of list structure in lisp

static measurements of the list structure of
five large lisp programs are reported and analyzed 
in this paper  these measurements reveal substantial
regularity or predictability among poin ters to 
atoms and especially among poin ters to lists  pointers
to atoms are found to obey roughly zipfs law 
which governs word frequencies in natural languages poin ters
to lists usually poin t to a location physically 
nearby in memory  the use of such regularities in the
space-efficient representation of list structure 
is discussed  linearization of lists whereby successive
cdrs or cars are placed in consecutive memory 
locations whenever possible greatly strengthens the
observed regularity of list structure  it is shown 
that under some reasonable assumptions the entropy or
information content of a car-cdr pair in the programs 
measured is about 10 to 15 bits before linearization
and about 7 to 12 bits after
