control structures in illiac iv fortran

as part of an effort to design and implement
a fortran compiler on the illiac iv an extended 
fortran called ivtran has been developed  this language
provides a means of expressing data and control 
structures suitable for exploiting illiac iv parallelism
 this paper reviews the hardware characteristics 
of the illiac and singles out unconventional features
which could be expected to influence language and 
compiler design  the implications of these features for
data layout and algorithm structure are discussed 
and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation rather than
code structuring is the crucial illiac optimization 
problem  a satisfactory method of data allocation is
then presented  language structures to utilize 
this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described
