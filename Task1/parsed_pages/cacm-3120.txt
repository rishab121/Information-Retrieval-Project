an event-driven compiling technique

due to the linear structure of source text difficulties may arise in a 
one-pass compilation process  these difficulties occur when an entity
cannot be processed because of a forward reference to information
only obtainable from subsequent entities  classic solutions
ask for data structures appropriate for each case  a technique is
presented here which uses instead control structures namely events
and processes  the work of the compiler-writer becomes easier both
conceptually and in practice because he can forget these problems
at the outset and he avoids special processing for each problem
this technique has been applied to the construction of an algol
68 compiler  three examples from that implementation
are described and discussed here
