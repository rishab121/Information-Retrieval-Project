a fast algorithm for copying list structures

an algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarily
linked list structure into a block of 
contiguous storage locations without destroying  the original
list  apart from a fixed number of program 
variables no auxiliary storage such as a stack is used
 the algorithm needs no mark bits and operates 
in linear time  it is shown to be significantly faster
than fishers algorithm the fastest previous 
linear-time algorithm for the same problem  its speed
comes mainly from its efficient list-traversal 
technique which folds the processing stack into the
structure being built and from its classification 
of list cells into nine types which enables processing
operations to be optimized for each type
