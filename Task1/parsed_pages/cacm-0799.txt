design of a separable transition-diagram compiler

a cobol compiler design is presented which is
compact enough to permit rapid one-pass compilation 
of a large subset of cobol on a moderately large computer
 versions of the same compiler for smaller 
machines require only two working tapes plus a compiler
tape  the methods given are largely applicable 
to the construction of algol compilers
