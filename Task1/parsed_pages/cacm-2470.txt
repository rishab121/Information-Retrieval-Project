fen-an axiomatic basis for program semantics

a formal system is presented which abstracts
the notions of data item function and relation 
 it is argued that the system is more suitable than set
theory or its derivatives for the concise and 
accurate description of program semantics  it is shown
how the system can be used to build composite 
data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing
structuring and uniting  it is also demonstrated 
that completely new primitive types can be introduced
into languages through the mechanism of singleton 
data types  both deterministic and nondeterministic
functions are shown to be definable in the system 
 it is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment  the
nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system  the technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator y  the
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon the theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment conditional and iterative 
statements  an appendix is included which presents in
detail the formal system governing webs and fen 
the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper
