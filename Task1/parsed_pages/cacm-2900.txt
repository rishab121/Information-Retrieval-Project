some theorems to aid in solving the file allocation problem

the file allocation problem-ie the problem
of finding the optimal set of network sites at 
which to locate copies of a file-is known to be in general
polynomial complete  heuristics and other 
aids to finding optimal or near-optimal solutions are
therefore much needed  in this paper we present 
three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate
that certain sites should or should not be 
included in an optimal allocation
