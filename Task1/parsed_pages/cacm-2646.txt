a model for masking rotational latency by dynamic disk allocation

this paper presents the background and algorithms
for masking the rotational latency of a disk 
or drum  it discusses the anticipatory input and output
of blocks of data to buffer and primary memories 
for a mono-programmed computer system  a basic permutation
algorithm and several variations are given 
  because of the anticipatory nature of the i/o scheduling
these algorithms are restricted to classes 
of programs with predictable behavior  while the methods
are not restricted to numerical computations 
matrix and partial differential equation methods are
typical examples of their use  it is shown that 
latency may be masked using a small amount of buffer
memory  the methods discussed are independent of 
the overall size of the data base being considered
