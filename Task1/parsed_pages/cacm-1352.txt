automatic integration of a function with a parameter

two efficient methods for automatic numerical
integration are romberg integration and adaptive 
simpson integration  for integrands of the form fxgxa
where a is a parameter it is shown that 
rombergs method is more efficient  a fortran program
shows how to achieve this greater efficiency
