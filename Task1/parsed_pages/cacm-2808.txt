the lemniscate constants

the lemniscate constants and indeed some
of the methods used for actually computing them 
have played an enormous part in the development of
mathematics  an account is given here of some of 
the methods used-most of the derivations can be made
by elementary methods  this material can be used 
for teaching purposes and there is much relevant and
interesting historical material  the acceleration 
methods developed for the purpose of evaluating
these constants are useful in other problems
