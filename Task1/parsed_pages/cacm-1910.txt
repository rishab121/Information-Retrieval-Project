an algorithm for solving a special class
of tridiagonal systems of linear equations

an algorithm is presented for solving a system
of linear equation buk where b is tridiagonal 
and of a special form  it is shown that this algorithm
is almost twice as fast as the gaussian elimination 
method usually suggested for solving such systems 
in addition explicit formulas for the inverse and 
determinant of the matrix b are given
