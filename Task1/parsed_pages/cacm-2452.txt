evaluation and selection of file organization-a model and system

this work first discusses the factors that
affect file data base organization performance 
an elusive subject and then presents a methodology a
model and a programmed system to estimate primarily 
total storage costs and average access time of several
file organizations given a specific data base 
query characterization and device-related specifications
 based on these estimates an appropriate file 
structure may be selected for the specific situation
 the system is a convenient tool to study file 
structures and to facilitate as much as possible the process
of data base structure design and evaluation
