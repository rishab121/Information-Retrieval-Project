an example of hierarchical design and proof

hierarchical programming is being increasingly
recognized as helpful in the construction of 
large programs  users of hierarchical techniques claim
or predict substantial increases in productivity 
and in the reliability of the programs produced  in this
paper we describe a formal method for hierarchical 
program specification implementation and proof  we
apply this method to a significant list processing 
problem and also discuss a number of extensions to current
programming languages that ease hierarchical 
program design and proof
