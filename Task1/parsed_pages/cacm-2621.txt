a high security log-in procedure

the protection of time sharing systems from
unauthorized users is often achieved by the use 
of passwords  by using one-way ciphers to code the passwords
the risks involved with storing the passwords 
in the computer can be avoided  we discuss the selection
of a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that 
for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are
superior to one-way ciphers derived from sannon 
codes
