brad the brookhaven raster display

a multiconsole computer display system has
been designed that provides very rich displays at 
low unit cost  each brad brookhaven raster display
console can plot tens of thousands of points or 
up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second  after
an initial display system investment of $50,000 
each display with teletype costs less than $3,000
 the technique employed is that of programmatically 
generating a binary image of the desired display in a
computer  the image is written on a rotating drum 
memory  independent read heads continuously display
the picture which is generated by swept horizontal 
lines  a standard tv monitor serves as the display device
 the technique has two drawbacks  a computer 
must compute any image to be displayed  also the pointing
interaction is more difficult  this is 
because the pointing function gives only the coordinates
of the point on the screen  the inverse of 
the map generation process is required to calculate
the coordinates of the point on the screen  the 
inverse of the map generation process is required to
calculate the coordinates at the selected point 
in the input space
