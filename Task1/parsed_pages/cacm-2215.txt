application of game tree searching techniques
to sequential pattern recognition

a sequential pattern recognition spr procedure
does not test all the features of a pattern 
at once  instead it selects a feature to be tested  after
receiving the result of that test the procedure 
either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another
feature to be tested etc  medical diagnosis 
is an example of spr  in this paper the authors suggest
that spr be viewed as a one-person game played 
against nature chance  virtually all the powerful techniques
developed for searching two-person strictly 
competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
directly or by analogy into spr procedures 
 in particular one can incorporate the mini average
backing-up procedure and the gamma procedure 
which are the analogues of the minimax backing-up procedure
and the alpha-beta procedure respectively 
 some computer simulated experiments in character recognition
are presented  the results indicate that 
the approach is promising
