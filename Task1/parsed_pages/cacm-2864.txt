characteristics of program localities

the term locality has been used to denote that
subset of a programs segments which are referenced 
during a particular phase of its execution  a programs
behavior can be characterized in terms of its 
residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes
and the transitions between these localities 
 in this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicit
through a formal definition of what constitutes 
a phase of localized reference behavior and by a corresponding
mechanism for the detection of localities 
in actual reference strings  this definition provides
for the existence of a hierarchy of localities 
at any given time and the reasonableness of the definition
is supported by examples taken from actual 
programs  empirical data from a sample of production
algol 60 programs is used to display distributions 
of locality sizes and lifetimes and these results are
discussed in terms of their implications for the 
modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems
