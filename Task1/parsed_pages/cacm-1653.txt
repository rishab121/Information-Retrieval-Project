system performance evaluation survey and appraisal

the state of the art of system performance
evaluation is reviewed and evaluation goals and 
problems are examined  throughput turnaround and
availability are defined as fundamental measures 
of performance overhead and cpu speed are placed in
perspective  the appropriateness of instruction 
mixes kernels simulators and other tools is discussed
as well as pitfalls which may be encountered 
when using them  analysis simulation and synthesis are
presented as three levels of approach to evaluation 
requiring successively greater amounts of information
 the central role of measurement in performance 
evaluation and in the development of evaluation methods is explored
