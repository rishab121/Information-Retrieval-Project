scanned-display computer graphics

a television-like scanned-display system has
been successfully implemented on a honeywell ddp-224 
computer installation  the scanned image is stored
in the core memory of the computer and software 
scan conversion is used to convert the rectangular coordinates
of a point to the appropriate word and 
bit in an output display array in core storage  results
thus far indicate that flicker-free displays 
of large amounts of data are possible with reasonably
fast graphical interaction  a scanned image of 
size 240 x 254 points is displayed at a 30 frame-per-second rate
