theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components a identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval
b searching strategy how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material and
c file organization to make access to information 
efficient  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman verhoeff and belzer associated
with an object language be used  for searching 
strategy a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated  two approaches 
to file organization are discussed  one is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being 
relevant
