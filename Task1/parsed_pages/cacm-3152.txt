storage reorganization techniques for
matrix computation in a paging environment

in order to multiply matrices while minimizing
the number of page fetches required it is often more efficient to
reorganize the data into submatrix form and to use block multiplication 
rather than to use the best known algorithms which leave the
matrices stored in row-or column-oriented form  an efficient
method for accomplishing this reorganization is given  this also
makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound
for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting
the technique of strassen to the reorganized data  the reorganization/block 
multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for
matrices and pages of realistic size the strassen adaptation is
not  the former scheme is also shown to be advantageous even if
the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost
