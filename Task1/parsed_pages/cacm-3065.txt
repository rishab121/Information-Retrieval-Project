right brother trees

insertion and deletion are provided for the
class of right or one-sided brother trees which 
have o log n performance  the importance of these
results stems from the close relationship of right 
brother trees which have an insertion algorithm operating
in o log2 n  further although both insertion 
and deletion can be  carried out in o log n time for
right brother trees it appears that the insertion 
algorithm is inherently much more difficult than the
deletion algorithm-the reverse of what one usually 
obtains
