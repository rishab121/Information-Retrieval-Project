a method for finding the m smallest values of
a monotonic function defined on ordered sets of 
positive integers

the minimum value of a monotonic increasing
function defined on a partially ordered set s is 
assumed on the set of minimal points of s  this observation
is used to devise an efficient method for 
finding the m smallest functional values of monotonic
functions defined on ordered pairs of positive 
integers  the method is easily extended to include
monotonic functions defined on ordered n-tuples 
 included is a fortran program which was written to implement
the procedure for a certain important case
