a fast division technique for constant divisors

a fast algorithm for division by constant divisors
is presented  the method has proved very 
useful implemented as microcode ona binary machine
and can be adapted directly into hardware  the 
mathematical foundations of the algorithm are presented
as well as some performance measures
