cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value problems

the cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order
differential equation y+pxy+qxy+rxytx 
is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrence
relationship  for some special cases the 
approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite
difference representation with a local truncation 
error of order y/720delta^8
