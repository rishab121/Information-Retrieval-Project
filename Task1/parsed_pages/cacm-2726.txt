combining decision rules in a decision table

the techniques for minimizing logic circuits
are applied to the simplification of decision 
tables by the combining of decision rules this method
is logically equivalent to the quien-mccluskey 
method for finding prime implicants  if some of the
decision rules implied in the else rule occur with 
low frequency then the else rule can be used to further
simplify the decision table  several objectives 
merit consideration in optimizing a decision table1
reducing machine execution time 2 reducing 
preprocessing time 3 reducing required machine memory
4 reducing the number of decision rules 
 this often improves the clarity of the decision table
to a human reader  it will be shown that objectives 
3 and 4 can be furthered with the above methods
 objective 1 is also attained if overspecified 
decision rules are not combined  objective 2 must be
compared against the potential benefits of objectives 
1 3 and 4 in deciding whether to use the above methods
