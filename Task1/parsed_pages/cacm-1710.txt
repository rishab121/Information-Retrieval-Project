asp-a ring implemented associative structure package

asp is a general purpose associative data
structure package in which an arbitrary number of 
data items and an arbitrary number of the relationships
between these data items may be represented 
 a special picture language is described which has proved
very useful for drawing asp structures on paper 
 asp structures are built and manipulated by means
of a series of macro calls which are outlined in 
the appendix  emphasis is on the philosophy of the system
rather than a particular implementation though 
sufficient information is included to enable the
reader to produce his own implementation of asp
