a case studi in program for parallel processor an affirm
partial answer is provid to the question of whether it
is possibl to program parallel processor comput system to effici
decreas execut time for us problem parallel processor system ar
multiprocessor system in which sever of the processor can simultan
execut separ task of a singl job thu cooper to
decreas the solut time of a comput problem the processor
have independ instruct counter mean that each processor execut it
own task program rel independ of the other processor commun
between cooper processor is by mean of data in storag
share by all processor a program for the determin of
the distribut of current in an electr network wa written
for a parallel processor comput system and execut of thi

the effici solut of thi problem typic of a larg
class of import problem it is shown that with proper
program solut time when n processor ar appli approach 1
