digit synthesi of correl stationari nois in thi note we
propos a method of gener stationari nois with a prescrib
auto covari function by digit method the need for such
a techniqu often aris in test the perform of data
process and engin system where input corrupt with correl nois
of a known form ar requir the techniqu is quit
simpl and produc strict sens stationari nois which agre approxim
with r t the prescrib auto covari function acf over
an interv t 0 t 0 the method consist of
approxim the spectral densiti by a period process with spectral
line and then synthes the period nois with random phase
and appropri amplitud in order to simplifi discuss of the
statist properti of the nois gener the techniqu is first
present in term of exact harmon analysi in practic discret
harmon analysi as present in the third section is us
