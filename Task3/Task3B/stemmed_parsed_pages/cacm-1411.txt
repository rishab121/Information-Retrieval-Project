comparison of sever algorithm for comput of mean standard deviat
and correl coeffici sever algorithm for comput of basic statist
ar compar by their perform on systemat gener test data
the statist calcul were the mean standard deviat and correl
coeffici for each statist the algorithm includ the usual comput
formula correct due to an accumul error term and a
recurs comput of the current valu of the statist the
usual comput formula were also evalu in doubl precis larg
error were note for some calcul us the usual comput
formula the most reliabl techniqu wa correct of the initi
estim by us of an accumul error term to elimin
the need for make two pass on the data it
wa suggest that the initi estim of the mean be
obtain from a subset of the data cacm juli 1966
