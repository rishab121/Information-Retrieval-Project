a fast and usual linear algorithm for global flow analysi
abstract onli complet paper jacm 23 1 januari 1976 a
new algorithm for global flow analysi on reduc graph is
present the algorithm is shown to treat a veri gener
class of function space for a graph of e edg
the algorithm ha a worst case time bound of o
e log e function oper it is also shown that
in program term the number of oper is proport to
e plu the number of exit from program loop consequ
a restrict to on entri on exit control structur linear
the algorithm can be extend to yet larger class of
function space and graph by relax the time bound exampl
ar given of code improv problem which can be solv
