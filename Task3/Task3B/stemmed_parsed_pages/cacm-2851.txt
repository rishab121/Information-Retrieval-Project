formal verif of parallel program two formal model for parallel
comput ar present an abstract conceptu model and a parallel
program model the former model doe not distinguish between control
and data state the latter model includ the capabl for
the represent of an infinit set of control state by

execut the program an induct principl is present which treat
the control and data state set on the same ground
through the us of place variabl it is observ that
certain correct condit can be express without enumer of the
set of all possibl control state exampl ar present in
which the induct principl is us to demonstr proof of

ar special case of the induct principl a special case
of the assert method which is call parallel place assert
is shown to be incomplet a formal of deadlock is
