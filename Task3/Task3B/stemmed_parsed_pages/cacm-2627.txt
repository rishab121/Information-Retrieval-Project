schedul independ task to reduc mean finish time sequenc to
minim mean finish time or mean time in system is
not onli desir to the user but it also tend
to minim at each point in time the storag requir
to hold incomplet task in thi paper a determinist model
of independ task is introduc and new result ar deriv
which extend and gener the algorithm known for minim mean
finish time in addit to present and analyz new algorithm
it is shown that the most gener mean finish time
problem for independ task is polynomi complet and henc unlik
