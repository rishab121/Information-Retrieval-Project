complex gamma function with error control an algorithm to comput
the gamma function and log gamma function of a complex
variabl is present the standard algorithm is modifi in sever
respect to insur the continu of the function valu and
to reduc accumul of round off error in addit to
comput of function valu thi algorithm includ an object time
estim of round off error experiment data with regard to
the effect of thi error control ar present a fortran
program for the algorithm appear in the algorithm section of
thi issu cacm april 1972 kuki h complex gamma function
