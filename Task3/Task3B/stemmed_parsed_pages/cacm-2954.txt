a bound storag algorithm for copi cyclic structur a new
algorithm is present which copi cyclic list structur us bound
workspac and linear time unlik a previou similar algorithm thi
on make no assumpt about the storag alloc system in
us and us onli oper like to be avail in
a high level languag the distinct featur of thi algorithm
is a techniqu for travers the structur twice us the
same span tree in each case first from left to
right and then from right to left cacm june 1977
