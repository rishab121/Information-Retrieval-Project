on the complex of lr k test the problem of
determin whether an arbitrari context free grammar is a member
of some easili pars subclass of grammar such as the
lr k grammar is consid the time complex of thi
problem is analyz both when k is consid to be
a fix integ and when k is consid to be
a paramet of the test in the first case it
is shown that for everi k there exist an o
n k 2 algorithm for test the lr k properti
where n is the size of the grammar in question
on the other hand if both k and the subject
grammar ar problem paramet then the complex of the problem
depend veri strongli on the represent chosen for k more
specif it is shown that thi problem is np complet
when k is express in unari when k is express
in binari the problem is complet for nondeterminist exponenti time
these result carri over to mani other parameter class of
grammar such as the ll k strong ll k slr
