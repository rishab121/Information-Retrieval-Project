a unifi comput method for the analysi of complet factori
experi a comput method which mai be us for the
calcul of sum of squar in the analysi of varianc
of complet factori experi and in the comput of main
effect or interact mean is describ the method is elucid
as unifi sinc on method can be us for a
varieti of purpos each previous requir differ method the program
advantag of such a method ar obviou the follow variant
ar discuss 1 the standard analysi of varianc 2 analys
omit certain level of on or more factor 3 separ
analys for some level of a factor or for combin
of level of more than on factor these ar perform
simultan 4 the calcul of main effect or interact mean
the mean expect the data in standard order and it
leav the data in that order so that mani analys
of the same data can be perform without rearrang the
total sum of squar exclud a replic sum of squar
is partit into all polynomi partit and their interact each
with on degre of freedom thi is so even if
factor have unequ space factor level cacm januari 1967 cooper
