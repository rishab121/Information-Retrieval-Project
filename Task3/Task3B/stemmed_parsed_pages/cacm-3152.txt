storag reorgan techniqu for matrix comput in a page environ
in order to multipli matric while minim the number of
page fetch requir it is often more effici to reorgan
the data into submatrix form and to us block multipl
rather than to us the best known algorithm which leav
the matric store in row or column orient form an
effici method for accomplish thi reorgan is given thi also
make possibl the deriv of an asymptot better bound for
multipl of matric given in row orient form by adapt
the techniqu of strassen to the reorgan data the reorgan
block multipl scheme is shown to be advantag for matric
and page of realist size the strassen adapt is not
the former scheme is also shown to be advantag even
if the transpos of on of the matric is avail
