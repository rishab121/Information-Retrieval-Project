an applic of formac a nonlinear circuit analysi problem is
state and the wai in which it wa solv us
formac is indic the solut of the problem us formac
wa notabl sinc sever other method that were tri fail
the problem is straightforward although unten by hand but nevertheless
involv an elabor us of the formac languag the program
wa fairli larg and util practic everi command in particular
it made extens us of the part command sever trick
were necessari in order to circumv some of the shortcom
of the formac system thi paper is more concern with
the us of program techniqu in formac than with the
actual engin problem although reader mai be interest in the
problem becaus it is state in a gener mathemat sens
and could be of interest in area other than circuit
