a comput analysi method for thermal diffus in biochem system
in the thermal detect of rapid biochem reaction it is
necessari to correct the temperatur data for transient heat conduct
loss in a cylindr calorimet to handl the complex aris
from vari thermal relax time of concentr insul layer a
comput program wa develop which give the temperatur distribut of
the system as a function of radiu and time thi
distribut is correct at each step by a subroutin which
calcul the instantan chemic state of there action as well
as the heat produc by thi reaction the program is
base on a direct statement of fourier s law of
heat conduct and the chemic rate equat to provid a
bookkeep law to follow the reactant and the flow of
heat packet in such a wai that the comput continu
store the heat distribut a comput analysi method is here
regard as on in which the physic law of a
process ar us explicitli in the program usual thi result
in by pass much of the mathemat procedur convention us
the program wa test against some known exact solut of
the heat equat and gave ident result and compar well
with experiment data of a known biochem reaction the construct
of comput program base on the direct statement of the
physic law is a principl of gener applic which ha
been appli to sever other physic phenomena cacm septemb 1964
