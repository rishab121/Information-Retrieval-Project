tabl is discuss it is point out that ani attempt
at resolv ambigu at compil time will in gener be
imposs it is shown that as a consequ tree method
of convert decis tabl to program ar inadequ in regard
to ambigu detect two algorithm for program decis tabl whose
merit ar simplic of implement and detect of ambigu at
execut time ar present the first algorithm is for limit
entri decis tabl and clarifi the import of proper code
of the inform in the decis tabl the second algorithm
program a mix entri decis tabl directli without go through
the intermedi step of convers to a limit entri form
therebi result in storag economi a comparison of the algorithm
and other propos in the literatur is made some featur
