the convers of limit entri decis tabl to optim and
near optim flowchart two new algorithm two new algorithm for
deriv optim and near optim flowchart from limit entri decis
tabl ar present both take into account rule frequenc and
the time need to test condit on of the algorithm
call the optimum find algorithm lead to a flowchart which
truli minim execut time for a decis tabl in which
simpl rule ar alreadi contract to complex rule the other
on call the optimum approach algorithm requir mani fewer calcul
but doe not necessarili produc the optimum flowchart the algorithm
ar first deriv for treat decis tabl not contain an
els rule but the optimum approach algorithm is shown to
be equal valid for tabl includ such a rule both
algorithm ar compar with exist on and ar appli to
a somewhat larg decis tabl deriv from a real case
from thi comparison two conclus ar drawn 1 the optimum
approach algorithm will usual lead to better result than compar
exist on and will not requir more but usual less
comput time 2 in gener the greater comput effort need
for appli the optimum find algorithm will not be justifi
by the small reduct in execut time obtain cacm novemb
