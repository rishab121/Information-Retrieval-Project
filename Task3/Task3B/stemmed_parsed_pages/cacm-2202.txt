dynam microprogram processor organ and program a dynam microprogram processor
is character by a small 4 k 64 bit word
read write micro storag the access time of thi storag
is similar to the cycl time of the machin 50
100 nsec thi microstorag is us to contain both data
and subroutin the micro instruct in such a processor differ
from the convent in that thei perform onli pure combinatori
oper sequenc is under the control of the microinstruct the
presenc of the read write microstorag permit a more flexibl
assign of resourc than the read onli storag in particular
the processor develop in thi paper stress the simultan oper
within the microinstruct of the adder shifter masker and test
facil of the processor a microassembl languag is develop and
the overhead involv in subroutin linkag is analyz the effici
of a flexibl softwar linkag scheme is examin as to
it overhead for variou subroutin characterist final three exampl of
