a fast fourier transform algorithm for real valu seri a
new procedur is present for calcul the complex discret fourier
transform of real valu time seri thi procedur is describ
for an exampl where the number of point in the
seri is an integr power of two thi algorithm preserv
the order and symmetri of the coolei turkei fast fourier
transform algorithm while effect the two to on reduct in
comput and storag which can be achiev when the seri
is real also discuss ar hardwar and softwar implement of
the algorithm which perform onli n 4 log2 n 2
complex multipli and add oper and which requir onli n
