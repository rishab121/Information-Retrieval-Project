the inequ 10 8 2 27 we ar like to
conclud that we can repres 8 digit decim float point
number accur by 27 bit float point number howev we
need 28 signific bit to repres some 8 digit number
accur in gener we can show that if 10 p
2 q 1 then q signific bit ar alwai enough
for p digit decim accuraci final we can defin a
compact 27 bit float point represent that will give 28
signific bit for number of practic import cacm februari 1967
