a comparison of the primal simplex and primal dual algorithm
for linear program a statist comparison of the primal dual
and the more commonli us primal simplex algorithm for solv
linear program problem ha been made under the assumpt of
start with a full artifici basi under these condit the
primal dual method show a statist signific superior on randomli
gener problem it ha also been found via a regress
analysi that the relev paramet in determin the differ in
the number of iter between the algorithm is not onli
the number of constraint and the number of variabl but
also the ratio of the latter to the former cacm
