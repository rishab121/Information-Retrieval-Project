on the optim detect of curv in noisi pictur a
techniqu for recogn system of line is present in thi
techniqu the heurist of the problem is not embed in
the recognit algorithm but is express in a figur of
merit a multistag decis process is then abl to recogn
in the input pictur the optim system of line accord
to the given figur of merit due to the global
approach greater flexibl and adequaci in the particular problem is
achiev the relat between the structur of the figur of
merit and the complex of the optim process is then
discuss the method describ is suitabl for parallel process becaus
the oper rel to each state can be comput in
parallel and the number of stage is equal to the
length n of the curv or to log2 n if
