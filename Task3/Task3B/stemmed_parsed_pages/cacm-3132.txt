experi with some algorithm that find central solut for pattern
classif in two class pattern recognit it is a standard
techniqu to have an algorithm find hyperplan which separ the
two class in a linearli separ train set the tradit
method find a hyperplan which separ all point in the
other but such a hyperplan is not necessarili center in
the empti space between the two class sinc a central
hyperplan doe not favor on class or the other it
should have a lower error rate in classifi new point
and is therefor better than a noncentr hyperplan six algorithm
for find central hyperplan ar test on three data set
although frequent us practic the modifi relax algorithm is veri
poor three algorithm which ar defin in the paper ar
found to be quit good cacm march 1979 slagl j
