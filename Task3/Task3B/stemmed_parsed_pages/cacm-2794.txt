paper suggest a bidirect relationship between state space and problem
reduct represent it present a formal base on multipl input
and multipl output oper which provid a basi for view
the two type of represent in thi manner a represent
of the languag recognit problem which is base on the

theorem prover determin whether the set of claus is interpret
in the state spacer mode or in the problem reduct
mode is present the analog concept in problem reduct and
