a fast algorithm for comput longest common subsequ previous publish
algorithm for find the longest common subsequ of two sequenc
of length n have had a best case run time
of o n 2 an algorithm for thi problem is
present which ha a run time of o r n
log n where r is the total number of order
pair of posit at which the two sequenc match thu
in the worst case the algorithm ha a run time
of o n 2 log n howev for those applic
where most posit of on sequenc match rel few posit
in the other sequenc a run time of o n
