quadratur is a particularli import automat quadratur scheme for a
varieti of reason especi the high accuraci obtain from rel
few integrand valu howev it ha receiv littl us becaus
it requir the comput of a cosin transform and the
arithmet cost of thi ha been prohibit thi paper is
in two part a companion paper ii comput the cosin
transform show that thi object can be overcom by comput
the cosin transform by a modif of the fast fourier
