model for parallel process within program applic to cpu i
o and i o i o overlap approxim queue model
for intern parallel process by individu program in a multiprogram
system ar develop in thi paper the solut techniqu is
develop by network decomposit the model ar formul in term
of cpu i o and i o i o overlap
and appli to the analysi of these problem the percentag
perform improv from cpu i o overlap is found to
be greatest for system which ar in approxim cpu i
o util balanc and for low degre of multiprogram the
percentag improv from i o i o overlap is found
to be greatest for systemtem in which the i o
system is more util than the cpu cacm octob 1978
