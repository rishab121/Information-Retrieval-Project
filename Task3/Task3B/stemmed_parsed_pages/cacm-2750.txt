hierarchi data set alloc in todai s multilevel storag system
is usual base on qualit ad hoc decis while it
would be desir to obtain an optim solut to thi
alloc problem it is clear that the number of paramet
involv make it intract to straight forward solut in such
a situat we must find a set of assumpt which
simplifi the problem greatli but which still provid a basi
for consid all signific cost element thi paper present such
a first quantit alloc step it consid mani of the
