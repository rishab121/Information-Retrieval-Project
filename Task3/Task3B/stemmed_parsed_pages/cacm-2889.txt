perform of height balanc tree thi paper present the result
of simul that investig the perform of height balanc hb
k tree it is shown that the onli statist of
hb 1 tree avl tree that is a function of
the size of the tree is the time to search
for an item in the tree for suffici larg tree
the execut time of all procedur for maintain hb 1
tree ar independ of the size of the tree in
particular an averag of 465 restructur ar requir per insert
with an averag of 2 78 node revisit to restor
the hb 1 properti an averag of 214 restructur ar
requir per delet with an averag of 1 91 node
revisit to restor the hb 1 properti moreov the execut
time of procedur for maintain hb k tree for k
1 ar also independ of the size of the tree
except for the averag number of node revisit on a
delet oper in order to restor the hb k properti
on trace back the cost of maintain hb k tree
drop sharpli as the allow imbal k increas both analyt
and experiment result that show the cost of maintain hb
k tree as a function of k ar discuss cacm
