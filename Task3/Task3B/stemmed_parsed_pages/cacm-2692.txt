reentrant polygon clip a new famili of clip algorithm is
describ these algorithm ar abl to clip polygon against irregular
convex plane face volum in three dimens remov the part
of the polygon which lie outsid the volum in two
dimens the algorithm permit clip against irregular convex window polygon
to be clip ar repres as an order sequenc of
vertic without repetit of first and last in mark contrast
to represent as a collect of edg as wa heretofor
the common procedur output polygon have an ident format with
new vertic introduc in sequenc to describ ani newli cut
edg or edg the algorithm easili handl the particularli difficult
problem of detect that a new vertex mai be requir
at a corner of the clip window the algorithm describ
achiev consider simplic by clip separ against each clip plane
or window boundari code capabl of clip the polygon against
a singl boundari is reenter to clip against subsequ boundari
each such reentrant stage of clip need store onli two
vertex valu and mai begin it process as soon as
the first output vertex from the proceed stage is readi
becaus the same code is reenter for clip against subsequ
boundari clip against veri complex window shape is practic for
perspect applic in three diment a six plane truncat pyramid
is chosen as the clip volum the two addit plane
parallel to the project screen serv to limit the rang
of depth preserv through the project a perspect project method
