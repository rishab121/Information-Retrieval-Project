on the construct of a repres synthet workload a gener
method of construct a drive workload repres of a real
workload is describ the real workload is character by it
demand on the variou system resourc these characterist of the
real workload ar obtain from the system account data the
characterist of the drive workload ar determin by match the
joint probabl densiti of the real workload with that of
the drive workload the drive workload is realiz by us
a synthet program in which the characterist can be vari
by vari the appropri paramet calibr experi ar conduct to
determin express relat the synthet program paramet with the workload
characterist the gener method is appli to the case of
