optimum merg from mass storag an algorithm is displai which
yield the merg order such that the total read time
defin to be the sum of seek time plu data
transfer time is minim for a sort us mass storag
the analysi is parameter in term of the ratio of
seek time to the time it take to fill avail
core with record and the file size in unit of
core length and thu it can be appli to ani
convent cpu mass storag combin an explicit formula for total
read time is deriv in term of the paramet which
correl veri well with the total read time calcul us
the optimum merg order yield by the algorithm the formula
involv the root of a simpl transcendent equat a short
