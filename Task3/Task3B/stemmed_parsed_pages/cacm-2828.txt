hierarch geometr model for visibl surfac algorithm the geometr structur
inher in the definit of the shape of three dimension
object and environ is us not just to defin their
rel motion and placement but also to assist in solv
mani other problem of system for produc pictur by comput
by us an extens of tradit structur inform or a
geometr hierarchi five signific improv to current techniqu ar possibl
first the rang of complex of an environ is greatli
increas while the visibl complex of ani given scene is
kept within a fix upper limit second a meaning wai
is provid to vari the amount of detail present in
a scene third clip becom a veri fast logarithm search
for the resolv part of the environ within the field
of view fourth frame to frame coher and clip defin
a graphic work set or fraction of the total structur
that should be present in primari store for immedi access
by the visibl surfac algorithm final the geometr structur suggest
a recurs descent visibl surfac algorithm in which the comput
