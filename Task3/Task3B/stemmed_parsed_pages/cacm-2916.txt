a fast string search algorithm an algorithm is present that
search for the locat i of the first occurr of
a charact string pat in anoth string string dure the
search oper the charact of pat ar match start with
the last charact of pat the inform gain by start
the match at the end of the pattern often allow
the algorithm to proce in larg jump through the text
be search thu the algorithm ha the unusu properti that
in most case not all of the first i charact
of string ar inspect the number of charact actual inspect
on the averag decreas as a function of the length
of pat for a random english pattern of length 5
the algorithm will typic inspect i 4 charact of string
befor find a match at i furthermor the algorithm ha
been implement so that on the averag fewer than i
patlen machin instruct ar execut these conclus ar support with
