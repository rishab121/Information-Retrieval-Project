the simplex method of linear program us lu decomposit standard
comput implement of dantzig s simplex method for linear program
ar base upon form the invers of the basic matrix
and updat the invers after everi step of the method
these implement have bad round off error properti thi paper
give the theoret background for an implement which is base
upon the lu decomposit comput with row interchang of the
basic matrix the implement is slow but ha good round
off error behavior the implement appear as cacm algorithm 350
