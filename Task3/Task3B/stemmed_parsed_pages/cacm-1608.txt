numer integr of function that ha a pole it is
common to need to integr numer function that diverg somewher
outsid the rang of integr even if the diverg occur
quit far awai integr formula like simpson s that depend
on fit a polynomi usual will be inaccur near a
pole thei will be veri bad a method is describ
that give formula that will integr function of thi kind
accur if the order and posit of the pole ar
known explicit formula ar given that ar easi to us
on an automat comput it is shown that thei can
be us for some other singular as well as pole
if the integr converg integr can be carri to the
singular the accuraci of the integr with a pole of
second order is discuss and as an exam
