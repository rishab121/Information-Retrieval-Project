an iter factor techniqu for polynomi an iter techniqu is
displai wherebi factor of arbitrari degre can be found for
polynomi in on variabl converg is shown to occur alwai
if a certain jacobian doe not vanish and if the
initi approxim to a factor is near enough to an
actual factor the process is simpli program and preliminari result
indic it to be well adapt to us with digit
comput for factor of degre two the techniqu is similar
to that of bairstow the present method be somewhat simpler
