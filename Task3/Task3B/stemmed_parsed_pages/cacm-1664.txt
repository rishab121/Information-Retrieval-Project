an algorithm for deriv the equat of mathemat physic by
symbol manipul a method is describ wherebi a digit comput
can be us to deriv the equat of mathemat physic
in ani curvilinear coordin system request by the user the
effect of the techniqu is demonstr by us it to
deriv the navier stoke equat of fluid motion and the
continu equat to deriv these equat by thi method the
user need know onli the coordin transform equat relat the
curvilinear coordin of interest to an orthogon cartesian triad when
thi program is us and the coordin transform equat ar
suppli as input the comput will deriv the navier stoke
equat and the continu equat the equat obtain will be
rel to the curvilinear coordin system specifi by the transform
equat us as input in thi paper the emphasi is
on theoret consider and methodolog rather than on program detail
