a simpl automat deriv evalu program a procedur for automat
evalu of total partial deriv of arbitrari algebra function is
present the techniqu permit comput of numer valu of deriv
without develop analyt express for the deriv the kei to
the method is the decomposit of the given function by
introduct of intermedi variabl into a seri of elementari function
step a librari of elementari function subroutin is provid for
the automat evalu and differenti of these new variabl the
final step in thi process produc the desir function s
deriv the main featur of thi approach is it simplic
it can be us as a quick reaction tool where
the deriv of analyt deriv is labori and also as
a debug tool for program which contain deriv cacm august
