numer properti of the ritz trefftz algorithm for optim control
in thi paper the ritz trefftz algorithm is appli to
the comput solut of the state regul problem the algorithm
repres a modif of the ritz direct method and is
design to improv the speed of solut and the storag
requir to the point where real time implement becom feasibl
the modif is shown to be more stabl computation than
the tradit ritz approach the first concern of the paper
is to describ the algorithm and establish it properti as
a valid and us numer techniqu in particular such us
properti as definit and reason of condit ar establish for
the method the second part of the paper is devot
to a comparison of the new techniqu with the standard
procedur of numer integr a matrix riccati equat to determin
a feedback matrix the new techniqu is shown to be
significantli faster for compar accuraci cacm june 1971 bosarg jr
