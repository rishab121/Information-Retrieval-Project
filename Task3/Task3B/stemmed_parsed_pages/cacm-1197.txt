find zero of a polynomi by the q d algorithm
a method which find simultan all the zero of a
polynomi develop by h rutishaus ha been test on a
number of polynomi with real coeffici thi slowli converg method
the quotient differ q d algorithm provid start valu for
a newton or a bairstow algorithm for more rapid converg
necessari and suffici condit for the exist of the q
d scheme ar not complet known howev failur mai occur
when zero have equal or nearli equal magnitud success wa
achiev in most of the case tri with the failur
usual traceabl to the equal magnitud difficulti in some case
comput roundoff mai result in error which spoil the scheme
even if the q d algorithm doe not give all
the zero it will usual find a major of them
