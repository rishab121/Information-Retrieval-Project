a us of fast and slow memori in list process
languag a scheme is describ which permit a substanti increas
in memori space util to store list structur data it
consist in reduc to on level a nonhomogen store compos
of fast core and slow disk or drum memori the
space avail in slow memori is divid into page each
contain a given number of machin word the reduct to
a on level memori is perform by a program which
leav the most often call page in the fast memori
when a new page from slow store is request the
page in core have the longest period of inact is
transfer back to the slow store the complet scheme ha
been implement in connect with a lisp embed into algol
us an ibm 7044 with 32k of core memori and
disk gain in memori space were about 100 fold as
often happen in program applic the price of the addit
space is comput time although the disk have an access
time 10 4 time slower than core test indic that
the actual slow down vari from 3 to 10 depend
on the number of page avail in the fast store
