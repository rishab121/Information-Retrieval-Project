gener of rosari permut express in hamiltonian circuit systemat gener
of a specif class of permut fundament to schedul problem
is describ in a nonori complet graph with n vertic
hamitonian circuit equival to 5 n 1 specif permut of
n element term rosari permut can be defin each of
them correspond to two circular permut which mirror imag each
other and is gener success by a number system cover
3 4 n 1 set of edg everi set of
edg e k 1 e k k 3 k n
1 is determin recurs by construct a hamiltonian circuit with
k vertic from a hamiltonian circuit with k 1 vertic
start with the hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertic the basic
oper consist of transposit of a pair of adjac vertic
where the posit of the pair in the permut is
determin by e k two algorithm treat the same exampl
for five vertic ar present it is veri easi to
deriv all possibl n permut from the 5 n 1
rosari permut be cycl the permut and by take them
in the revers order procedur which can be perform fairli
