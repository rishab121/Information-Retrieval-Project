determin the minimum area encas rectangl for an arbitrari close
curv thi paper describ a method for find the rectangl
of minimum area in which a given arbitrari plane curv
can be contain the method is of interest in certain
pack and optimum layout problem it consist of first determin
the minim perimet convex polygon that enclos the given curv
and then select the rectangl of minimum area capabl of
contain thi polygon three theorem ar introduc to show that
on side of the minimum area rectangl must be colinear
with an edg of the enclos polygon and that the
minimum area encas rectangl for the convex polygon is also
