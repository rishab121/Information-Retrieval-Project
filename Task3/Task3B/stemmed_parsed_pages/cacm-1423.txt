a simpl algorithm for comput the gener invers of a
matrix the gener invers of a matrix is import in
analysi becaus it provid an extens of the concept of
an invers which appli to all matric it also ha
mani applic in numer analysi but it is not wide
us becaus the exist algorithm ar fairli complic and requir
consider storag space a simpl extens ha been found to
the convent orthogon method for invert non singular matric which
give the gener invers with littl extra effort and with
no addit storag requir the algorithm give the gener invers
for ani m by n matrix a includ the special
case when m n and a is non singular and
the case when m n and rank a n in
the first case the algorithm give the ordinari invers of
a in the second case the algorithm yield the ordinari
least squar transform matrix inv a a a and ha
the advantag of avoid the loss of signific which result
in form the product a a explicitli cacm mai 1966
