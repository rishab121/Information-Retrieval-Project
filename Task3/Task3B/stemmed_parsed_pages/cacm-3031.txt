abstract data type and softwar valid a data abstract can
be natur specifi us algebra axiom the virtu of these
axiom is that thei permit a represent independ formal specif
of a data type an exampl is given which show
how to emploi algebra axiom at success level of implement
the major thrust of the paper is twofold first it
is shown how the us of algebra axiomat can simplifi
the process of prove the correct of an implement of
an abstract data type second semi automat tool ar describ
which can be us both to autom such proof of
correct and to deriv an immedi implement from the axiom
