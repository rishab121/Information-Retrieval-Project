a comparison of multivari normal gener three method for gener
outcom on multivari normal random vector with a specifi varianc
covari matrix ar present a comparison is made to determin
which method requir the least comput execut time and memori
space when util the ibm 360 67 all method us
as a basi a standard gaussian random number gener result
of the comparison indic that the method base on triangular
factor of the covari matrix gener requir less memori space
and comput time than the other two method cacm decemb
