a practic interprocedur data flow analysi algorithm a new interprocedur
data flow analysi algorithm is present and analyz the algorithm
associ with each procedur in a program inform about which
variabl mai be modifi which mai be us and which
ar possibl preserv by a call on the procedur and
all of it subcal the algorithm is suffici power to
be us on recurs program and to deal with the
share of variabl which aris through refer paramet the algorithm
is uniqu in that it can comput all of thi
inform in a singl pass not requir a prepass to
comput call relationship or share pattern the algorithm is asymptot
optim in time complex it ha been implement and is
practic even on program which ar quit larg cacm septemb
