a comparison of simul event list algorithm four algorithm ar
consid which can be us to schedul event in a
gener purpos discret simul system two of the algorithm ar
new on is base on an end order tree structur
for event notic and anoth us an index linear list
the algorithm ar test with a set of typic stochast
schedul distribut especi chosen to show the advantag and limit
of the algorithm the end order tree algorithm is shown
to be an advantag immedi replac for the algorithm in
us with current simul languag the most promis algorithm us
the index list concept it will requir an adapt routin
befor it can be emploi in gener purpos simul but
it perform is such that further studi would be fruit
