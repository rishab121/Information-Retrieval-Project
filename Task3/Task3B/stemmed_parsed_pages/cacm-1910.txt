an algorithm for solv a special class of tridiagon system
of linear equat an algorithm is present for solv a
system of linear equat bu k where b is tridiagon
and of a special form it is shown that thi
algorithm is almost twice as fast as the gaussian elimin
method usual suggest for solv such system in addit explicit
formula for the invers and determin of the matrix b
