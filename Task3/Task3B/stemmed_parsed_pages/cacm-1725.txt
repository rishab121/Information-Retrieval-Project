a simpl proof of lewin s order retriev theorem for
associ memori an effici method of order retriev of binari
word from an associ memori as describ by lewin is
base on the us of special readout circuit which indic
the digit valu present in the individu digit column of
the memori thu the circuit indic whether the individu digit
column contain digit of both valu or of onli on
valu or contain no digit at all i e that
the memori is empti the us of these circuit which
in thi paper ar term column valu indic reduc consider
the number of memori access necessari to retriev in order
a number of distinct word from the memori lewin prove
that for the readout by the describ method of m
distinct binari word 2m 1 memori access ar necessari thu
he prove that the number of necessari memori access of
hi method unlik those of other method is independ of
the word length in thi paper a veri simpl proof
of thi theorem deriv from some elementari aspect of the
structur of set of binari number is present cacm juli
