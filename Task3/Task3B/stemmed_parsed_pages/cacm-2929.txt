an analysi of inlin substitut for a structur program languag
an optim techniqu known as inlin substitut is analyz the
optim consist of replac a procedur invoc by a modifi
copi of the procedur bodi the gener problem of us
inlin substitut to minim execut time subject to size constrain
ts is formul and an approxim algorithm solut is propos
the algorithm depend on run time statist about the program
to be optim preliminari result for the clu structur program
languag indic that in program with a low degre of
recurs over 90 percent of all procedur call can be
elimin with littl increas in the size of compil code
and a small save in execut time other conclus base
on these result ar also present cacm septemb 1977 scheifler
