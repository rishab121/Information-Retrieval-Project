multipl precis float point convers from decim to binari and
vice versa decim to binari and binari to decim float
point convers is often perform by us a tabl of
the power 10 i ia posit integ for convert from
base 10 to base 2 and by us a tabl
of the coeffici of a polynomi approxim of 10 x
0 x 1 for convert from base 2 to base
10 these tabl occupi a larg storag region in the
case of a nonsingl precis convers thi paper show that
a singl small tabl suffic for a float point convers
