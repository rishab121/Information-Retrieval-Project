on wai of estim frequenc of jump in a program
for the segment of a program it is us to
have a reason estim of the valu of s ij
where s ij is the mean valu of the number
of jump from the i th instruct on to the
j th instruct in the run time in the case
where the s ij ar estim directli the structur of
the whole program must be gener taken into account therefor
it is veri difficult for the programm and or the
translat to obtain a good estim of the s ij
it is easier to estim not s ij but the
quantiti p ij s ij c i sum s ij
j 1 n where c i is an arbitrari posit
constant for each i although the p ij ar for
each i proport to s ij the estim of p
ij is easier becaus we must estim onli the probabl
of event where instruct i is execut after instruct i
i thi estim can often be done without consid the
structur of the whole program in the first part of
the paper us the theori of the markov chain an
algorithm for the comput of the s ij from the
p ij is found and some wai of obtain estim
of the p ij ar given in the second part
a variant of thi algorithm is deriv avoid the necess
