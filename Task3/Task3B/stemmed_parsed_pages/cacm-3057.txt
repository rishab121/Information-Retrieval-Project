optim hi togram match by monoton grai level transform thi
paper investig the problem of optim hi togram match us
monoton grai level transform which alwai assign all pictur point
of a given grai level i to anoth grai level
t i such that if i j then t i
t j the object is to find a transform digit
pictur of a given pictur such that the sum of
absolut error between the grai level hi togram of the
transform pictur and that of a refer pictur is minim
thi is equival to place k1 linearli order object of
differ size on by on into k2 linearli order box
of assort size such that the accumul error of space
under pack or overpack in the box is minim the
placement function is monoton which ensur a polynomi time solut
to thi problem a tree search algorithm for optim hi
togram match is present which ha time complex o k1
x k2 if the monoton properti is drop then the
problem becom np complet even if it is restrict to
