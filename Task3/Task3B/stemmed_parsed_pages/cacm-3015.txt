relax method for imag reconstruct the problem of recov an
imag a function of two variabl from experiment avail integr
of it gray over thin strip is of great import
in a larg number of scientif area an import version
of the problem in medicin is that of obtain the
exact densiti distribut within the human bodi from x rai
projectionsn approach that ha been taken to solv thi problem
consist of translat the avail inform into a system of
linear inequ the size and the sparsiti of the result
system typic 25 000 inequ with fewer than 1 percent
of the coeffici nonzero make method us success relax computation
attract as compar to other wai of solv system of
inequ in thi paper it is shown that for a
consist system of linear inequ ani sequenc of relaxarion paramet
ly strictli between 0 and 2 gener a sequenc of
vector which converg to a solut under the same assumpt
for a system of linear equat the relax method converg
to the minimum norm solut previous propos techniqu ar shown
to be special case of our procedur with differ choic
of relax paramet the practic consequ for imag reconstruct of
the choic of the relax paramet ar discuss cacm februari
