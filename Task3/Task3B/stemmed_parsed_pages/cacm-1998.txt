complex matrix invers versu real a comparison of complex matrix
with real matrix invers is made it is shown that
the complex invers can be up to twice as fast
as the real invers further the round error bound for
complex invers is about on eighth that of real for
gaussian elimin us extend inner product accumul the bound is
half of the real system cacm septemb 1970 ehrlich l
