index rang for matrix calculi the paper describ a scheme
for symbol manipul of index express which aris as a
by product of the symbol manipul of express in the
matrix calculi describ by the author in a previou paper
thi scheme attempt program optim by transform the origin algorithm
rather than the machin code the goal is to automat
gener code for handl the tediou address calcul necessit by
