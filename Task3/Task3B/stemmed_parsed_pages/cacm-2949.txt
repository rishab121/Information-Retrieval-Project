a correct proof of a topolog inform main tenanc protocol
for a distribut comput network in order for the node
of a distribut comput network to commun each node must
have inform about the network s topolog sinc node and
link sometim crash a scheme is need to updat thi
inform on of the major constrain ts on such a
topolog inform scheme is that it mai not involv a
central control the topolog inform protocol that wa implement on
the merit comput network is present and explain thi protocol
is quit gener and could be implement on ani comput
network it is base on baran s hot potato heurist
