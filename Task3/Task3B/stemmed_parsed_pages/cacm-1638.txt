expect length of a sequenc begin with the i th
element i 1 is prove to be 2f in accord
with a conjectur of e h friend where f is
the number of memori cell us the expect length of
the j th sequenc is determin to be f time
a j th degre polynomi in e such that the
valu of thi polynomi approach 2 as j approach infin
recurs formula ar obtain for both the mean and the
standard deviat of the length of the j th sequenc
the mathemat proof of these result ar base upon the
assumpt that n the number of item to be sort
is infinit but it is shown that the error due
to the finit of n approach zero rapidli as n
