a statist studi of the accuraci of float point number
system thi paper present the statist result of test of
the accuraci of certain arithmet system in evalu sum product
and inner product and analyt error estim for some of
the comput the arithmet system studi ar 6 digit hexadecim
and 22 digit binari float point number represent combin with
the usual chop and round mode of arithmet with variou
number of guard digit and with a modifi round mode
with guard digit in a certain sens arithmet system differ
onli in their us of binari or hexadecim number represent
ar shown to be approxim statist equival inaccuraci further the
usual round mode with guard digit is shown to be
statist superior in accuraci to the usual chop mode in
