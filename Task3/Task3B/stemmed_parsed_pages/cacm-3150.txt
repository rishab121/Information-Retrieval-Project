beyond program languag as comput technolog matur our grow abil
to creat larg system is lead to basic chang in
the natur of program current program languag concept will not
be adequ for build and maintain system of the complex
call for by the task we attempt just as high
level languag enabl the programm to escap from the intricaci
of a machin s order code higher level program system
can provid the mean to understand and manipul complex system
and compon in order to develop such system we need
to shift our attent awai from the detail specif of
algorithm toward the descript of the properti of the packag
and object with which we build thi paper analyz some
of the shortcom of program languag as thei now exist
