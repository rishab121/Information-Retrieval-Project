algebra simplif a guid for the perplex algebra simplif is
examin first from the point of view of a user
who need to comprehend a larg express and second from
the point of view of a design who want to
construct a us and effici system first we describ variou
techniqu akin to substitut these techniqu can be us to
decreas thesiz of an express and make it more intellig
to a user then we delin the spectrum of approach
to the design of automat simplif capabl in an algebra
manipul system system ar divid into five type each type
provid differ facil for the manipul and simplif of express
final we discuss some of the theoret result relat to
algebra simplif we describ sever posit result about the exist
of power simplif algorithm and the number theoret conjectur on
