copi cyclic list structur in linear time us bound workspac
a bound workspac copi algorithm for arbitrari list structur is
given thi algorithm oper in linear time and doe not
requir tag bit the best previou bound workspac copi algorithm
achiev n 2 time without tag bit and n log
n time with on tag the onli restrict on the
algorithm given here is that the copi must be place
into a contigu section of memori the method is applic
to fix or variabl size node cacm mai 1975 fisher
