incorpor origin shift into the qr algorithm for symmetr tridiagon
matric the qr iter for the eigenvalu of a symmetr
tridiagon matrix can be acceler by incorpor a sequenc of
origin shift the origin shift mai be either subtract directli
from the diagon element of the matrix or incorpor by
mean of an implicit algorithm both method have drawback the
direct method can unnecessarili degrad small eigenvalu while the implicit
method can effect loos the shift and therebi retard the
converg thi paper present a new method which ha neither
drawback cacm june 1970 stewart g w eigenvalu eigenvector qr
