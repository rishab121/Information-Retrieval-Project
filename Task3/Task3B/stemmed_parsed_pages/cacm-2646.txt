a model for mask rotat latenc by dynam disk alloc
thi paper present the background and algorithm for mask the
rotat latenc of a disk or drum it discuss the
anticipatori input and output of block of data to buffer
and primari memori for a mono program comput system a
basic permut algorithm and sever variat ar given becaus of
the anticipatori natur of the i o schedul these algorithm
ar restrict to class of program with predict behavior while
the method ar not restrict to numer comput matrix and
partial differenti equat method ar typic exampl of their us
it is shown that latenc mai be mask us a
small amount of buffer memori the method discuss ar independ
of the overal size of the data base be consid
