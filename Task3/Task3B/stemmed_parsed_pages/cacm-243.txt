n dimension code for detect and correct multipl error the
paper introduc a new famili of code for detect and
correct multipl error in a binari code messag the messag
itself is arrang conceptu into a multidimension rectangular arrai the
process of encod and error detect ar base upon pariti
evalu along prescrib dimens of the arrai effect of the
code is increas by introduc a system check bit which
is essenti a pariti check on the other pariti bit
onli three dimension code ar discuss in thi paper with
pariti evalu along the horizont the vertic and on main
diagon howev the famili of code is not restrict to
three dimens as evidenc by the discuss by minnick and
ashenhurst on a similar multidimension singl bit select plan us
for anoth purpos 6 a four dimension code correct three
and detect four error ha been develop the extens to
higher dimension code with greater correct power is straightforward cacm
