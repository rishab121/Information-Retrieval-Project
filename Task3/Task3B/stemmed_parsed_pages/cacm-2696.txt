a method of bivari interpol and smooth surfac fit base
on local procedur a method is design for interpol valu
given at point of a rectangular grid in a plane
by a smooth bivari function z z x y the
interpol function is a bicub polynomi in each cell of
the rectangular grid emphasi is an avoid excess undul between
given grid point the propos method is an extens of
the method of univari interpol develop earlier by the author
and is likewis base on local procedur cacm januari 1974
