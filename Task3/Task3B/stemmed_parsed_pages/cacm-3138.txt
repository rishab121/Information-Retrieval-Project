a mathemat program updat method us modifi given transform and
appli to lp problem an effici and numer stabl method
is present for the problem of updat an orthogon decomposit
of a matrix of column or row vector the fundament
idea is to add a column or row analog to
ad an addit row of data in a linear least
squar problem a column or row is drop by a
formal scale with the imaginari unit 1 follow by least
squar addit of the column or row the elimin process
for the procedur is success ssive applic of the given
transform in modifi more effici form these idea ar illustr
with an implement of the revis simplex method the algorithm
is a gener purpos on that doe not account for
ani particular structur or sparsiti in the equat some suggest
comput test for determin sign of variou control paramet in
the revis simplex algorithm ar mention a simpl mean of
construct test case and some sampl comput time ar present
