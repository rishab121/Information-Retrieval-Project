optim shift strategi for a block transfer ccd memori for
the purpos of thi paper a block transfer ccd memori
is compos of serial shift regist whose shift rate can
vari but which have a definit minimum shift rate the
refresh rate and a definit maximum shift rate the bit
iin the shift regist ar number 0 to n 1
and block of n bit ar alwai transfer alwai start
at bit 0 what is the best shift strategi so
that a block transfer request occur at a random time
will have to wait the minim amount of time befor
bit 0 can be reach the minimum shift rate requir
doe not allow on to simpli park at bit 0
and wait for a transfer request the optim strategi involv
shift as slowli as possibl until bit 0 is pass
then shift as quickli as possibl until a critic boundari
is reach shortli befor bit 0 come around again thi
is call the hurri up and wait strategi and is
well known outsid the comput field the block transfer ccd
memori can also be view as a page drum with
