note on tripl precis float point arithmet with 132 bit
number in a recent paper gregori and ranei describ a
techniqu for doubl precis float point arithmet a similar techniqu
can be develop for tripl precis float point arithmet and
it is the purpos of thi note to describ thi
techniqu onli the multipl and the divis algorithm ar describ
sinc the addit subtract algorithm can be obtain by a
