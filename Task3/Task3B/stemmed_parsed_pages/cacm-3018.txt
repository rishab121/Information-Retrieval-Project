cover edg by cliqu with regard to keyword conflict and
intersect graph kellerman ha present a method for determin keyword
conflict and describ a heurist algorithm which solv a certain
combinatori optim problem in connect with thi method thi optim
problem is here shown to be equival to the problem
of cover the edg of a graph by complet subgraph
with the object of minim the number of complet subgraph
a relationship between thi edg cliqu cover problem and the
graph color problem is establish which allow algorithm for either
on of these problem to be construct from algorithm for
the other as consequ of thi relationship the keyword conflict
problem and the edg cliqu cover problem ar shown to
be np complet and if p np then thei do
not admit polynomi time approxim algorithm which alwai produc solut
within a factor less than 2 from the optimum cacm
