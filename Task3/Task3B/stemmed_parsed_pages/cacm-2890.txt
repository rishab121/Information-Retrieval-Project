on quadrat adapt rout algorithm two analyt model of a
store and forward commun network ar construct on to find
the optim messag rout and the other to illustr the
equilibrium stationari state maintain by an adapt rout algorithm these
model show that adapt rout doe not satisfi the necessari
condit for an optim rout adapt rout tend to overus
the direct path and underus altern rout becaus it doe
not consid the impact of it current rout decis on
the futur state of the network the form of the
optim condit suggest that a modif of the adapt algorithm
will result in optim the modif requir the substitut of
a quadrat bia term instead of a linear on in
