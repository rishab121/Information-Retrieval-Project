algorithm for find a fundament set of cycl for an
undirect linear graph given the adjac matrix of the graph
the algorithm present in thi paper find a span tree
and then construct the set of fundament cycl our algorithm
is slower than an algorithm present by welch by a
ratio of n 3 n is the number of node
but requir less storag for graph with a larg number
of node and edg when storag is limit our algorithm
is superior to welch s howev when the graph ar
small or machin storag is veri larg welch s algorithm
is superior time estim and storag requir for both method
