program for rout interconnect on a two side print circuit
board with a regular pattern of line pin termin and
via feed through hole is describ in thi program each
interconnect is given a plan rout typic down from the
upper pin through a via and horizont to the lower
pin from the top a virtual apertur i e a
long horizont slit is step down the board the plan
rout is the basi for rerout interconnect within the apertur
to resolv conflict for line and via below the apertur
and to maxim the effect line usag if a conflict
ha not been resolv befor the apertur arriv at the
