a graph formul of a school schedul algorithm the problem
classic titl the examin schedul problem take variou form in
the literatur most of these formul can be present in
the terminolog of classic network theori on such formul is
given a nondirect network partit it node into a minim
number of subset such that no two member of the
same subset ar connect by anarc an obviou lower limit
to thi number is the size of the largest strongli
connect subgraph kirchgassn prove that an upper limit is thi
size plu on on logic extens of the previou work
is the introduct of variabl length examin where w i
is the number of period for exam i the object
of thi paper is to gener the definit of largest
strongli connect subgraph to includ the weight of node to
present an approxim algorithm which usual find the largest strongli
connect subgraph and to discuss the applic of thi algorithm
to the solut of school schedul and exam schedul problem
