the augment predict analyz for context free languag it rel
effici it ha been proven by greibach that for a
given context free grammar g a standard form grammar gs
can be construct which gener the same languag as is
gener by g and whose rule ar all of the
form z cy 1 y m m o where z
and y i ar intermedi symbol and c a termin
symbol sinc the predict analyz at harvard us a standard
form grammar it can accept the languag of ani context
free grammar g given an equival standard form grammar gs
the structur descript sd gs x assign to a given
sentenc x by the predict analyz howev ar usual differ
from the structur descript sd g x assign to the
same sentenc by the origin context free grammar g from
which gs is deriv in section 1 an algorithm origin
due to abbott is describ standard form grammar each of
whose rule is in standard form supplement by addit inform
describ it deriv from the origin context free grammar a
techniqu for perform the sd gs x to sd g
x transform effect is also describ in section 2 the
augment predict analyz as a pars algorithm for arbitrari context
free languag is compar with two other pars algorithm a
select top to bottom algorithm similar to iron error correct
pars algorithm and an immedi constitu analyz which is an
extens of sakai cock s algorithm for normal grammar the
comparison is base upon sever criteria of effici cover core
