optim surfac reconstruct from planar contour in mani scientif and
technic endeavor a three dimension solid must be reconstruct from
serial section either to aid in the comprehens of the
object s structur or to facilit it automat manipul and
analysi thi paper present a gener solut to the problem
of construct a surfac over a set of cross section
contour thi surfac to be compos of triangular tile is
construct by separ determin an optim surfac between each pair
of consecut contour determin such a surfac is reduc to
the problem of find certain minimum cost cycl in a
direct toroid graph a new fast algorithm for find such
cycl is util also develop is a close form express
in term of the number of contour poin ts for
