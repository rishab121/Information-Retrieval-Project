on the normal requir of divisor in divid and correct
method thi paper present an analysi on the normal requir
of the divisor in a divid and correct method thi
analysi is made subject to the condit that not more
than on correct is requir to obtain the true quotient
charact from the trial estim got from the divis of
a two precis segment of everi partial remaind by a
suitabl round singl precis divisor thi segment divis is denot
here as a 2 1 precis basic divis it is
found that the normal requir could be narrow down to
a smaller rang of divisor provid the magnitud of the
charact next to the lead charact of the divisor is
known if howev the normal is to be elimin on
ha to choos proper higher precis segment of operand for
the basic divis also consid is the possibl of elimin
the normal by an increas on the number of correct
on the quotient estim got from a 2 1 precis
basic divis it is shown that such a scheme is
