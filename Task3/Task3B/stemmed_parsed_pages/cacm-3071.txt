an algorithm us symbol techniqu for the bel petrov classif
of gravit field in thi note an algorithm is present
for the symbol calcul of certain algebra invari of the
weyl tensor which permit the determin of the bel petrov
type of a gravit field thi algorithm although more special
than that of d inverno and russel clark requir neither
the us of a special coordin system nor the spin
coeffici formal the algorithm ha been implement in formac and
is design to complet the classif scheme propos by petrov
in hi book an appendix contain exampl illustr the us
