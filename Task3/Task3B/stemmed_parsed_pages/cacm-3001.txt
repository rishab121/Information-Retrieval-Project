detect of combin occurr in thi paper it is suppos
that the variabl x1 xn each have finit rang with
the variabl xi take on pi possibl valu and that
the valu of the variabl ar chang with time it
is suppos further that it is desir to detect occurr
in which some subset of the variabl achiev particular valu
final it is suppos that the problem involv the detect
of a larg number of combin occurr for a larg
number of chang of valu of variabl two effici solut
for thi problem ar describ both method have the unusu
properti of be faster for system where the sum p1
pn is larger the first solut is error free and
suitabl for most case the second solut is slightli more
eleg and allow negat as well as conjunct but is
subject to the possibl of error an error analysi is
given for the second method and an empir studi is
