problem in the statist analysi of simul experi the comparison
of mean and the length of sampl record research is
continu into statist analysi of simul experi contain autocorrel time
seri it is shown how to estim the length of
sampl record need to us certain larg sampl result in
measur stabil analog between autocorrel data and independ observ ar
describ a wai to test the differ of the mean
of two experi is suggest it is shown how the
varianc of the sampl mean relat to the spectrum of
the gener process and estim of the quantiti of interest
is describ the result expand the possibl of statist spectral
