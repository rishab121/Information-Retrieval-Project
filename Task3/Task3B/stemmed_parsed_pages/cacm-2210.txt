toward automat program synthesi an elementari outlin of the theorem
prove approach to automat program synthesi is given without dwell
on technic detail the method is illustr by the automat
construct of both recurs and iter program oper on natur
number list and tree in order to construct a program
satisfi certain specif a theorem induc by those specif is
prove and the desir program is extract from the proof
the same techniqu is appli to transform recurs defin function
into iter program frequent with a major gain ineffici it
is emphas that in order to construct a program with
loop or with recurs the principl of mathemat induct must
be appli the relat between the version of the induct
rule us and the form of the program construct is
