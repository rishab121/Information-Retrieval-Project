a weight buddi method for dynam storag alloc an extens
of the buddi method call the weight buddi method for
dynam storag alloc is present the weight buddi method allow
block size of 2 k and 3 2 k wherea
the origin buddi method allow onli block size of 2
k thi extens is achiev at an addit cost of
onli two bit per block simul result ar present which
compar thi method with the buddi method these result indic
that for a uniform request distribut the buddi system ha
less total memori fragment than the weight buddi algorithm howev
the total fragment is smaller for the weight buddi method
when the request ar for exponenti distribut block size cacm
