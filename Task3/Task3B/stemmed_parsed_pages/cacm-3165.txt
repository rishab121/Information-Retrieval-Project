approxim of polygon map by cellular map the approxim of
polygon themat map by cellular map an import oper in
geograph data process is analyz the data organ us for
repres the polygon map is a wide us segment base
data structur where class label identifi the region border each
segment on either side the approxim algorithm present oper on
such an organ elimin the need for the recognit of
region boundari each segment is examin onli onc the versatil
of the new organ is further illustr by the outlin
of algorithm for area comput and point inclus the algorithm
is appli to a set of soil map convert to
