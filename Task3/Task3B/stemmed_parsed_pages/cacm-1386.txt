symbol factor of polynomi in sever variabl an algorithm for
find the symbol factor of a multi variat polynomi with
integ coeffici is present the algorithm is an extens of
a techniqu us by kroneck in a proof that the
prime factor of ani polynomi mai be found in a
finit number of step the algorithm consist of factor singl
variabl instanc of the given polynomi by kroneck s method
and introduc the remain variabl by interpol techniqu for implement
the algorithm and sever exampl ar discuss the algorithm promis
suffici power to be us effici in an onlin system
