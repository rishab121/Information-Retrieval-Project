a fast algorithm for copi list structur an algorithm is
present for copi an arbitrarili link list structur into a
block of contigu storag locat without destroi the origin list
apart from a fix number of program variabl no auxiliari
storag such as a stack is us the algorithm need
no mark bit and oper in linear time it is
shown to be significantli faster than fisher s algorithm the
fastest previou linear time algorithm for the same problem it
speed come mainli from it effici list travers techniqu which
fold the process stack into the structur be built and
from it classif of list cell into nine type which
enabl process oper to be optim for each type cacm
