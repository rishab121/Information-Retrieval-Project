construct of ration and neg power of a formal seri
some method ar describ for the gener of fraction and
neg power of ani formal seri such as poisson seri
or chebyshev seri it is shown that with the us
of the three elementari oper of addit subtract and multipl
all ration posit and neg power of a seri can
be construct there ar basic two approach the binomi theorem
and the iter method both method ar describ here and
the relationship between them is point out some well known
classic formula ar obtain as particular case and it is
shown how the converg properti of these formula can be
