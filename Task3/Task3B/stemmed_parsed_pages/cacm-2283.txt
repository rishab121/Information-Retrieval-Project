thin algorithm on rectangular hexagon and triangular arrai in thi
report three thin algorithm ar develop on each for us
with rectangular hexagon and triangular arrai the approach to the
develop of each algorithm is the same pictori result produc
by each of the algorithm ar present and the rel
perform of the algorithm ar compar it is found that
the algorithm oper with the triangular arrai is the most
sensit to imag irregular and nois yet it will yield
a thin imag with an overal reduc number of point
it is conclud that the algorithm oper in conjunct with
the hexagon arrai ha featur which strike a balanc between
