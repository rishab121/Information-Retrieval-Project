we add 6 revers path forward a broadcast rout method
which exploit rout procedur and data structur alreadi avail for
packet switch revers path forward is a practic algorithm for
broadcast rout in store and forward packet switch comput network
the algorithm is describ as be practic becaus it is
not optim accord to metric develop for it analysi in
