minim total process time drum and disk schedul disciplin thi
articl investig the applic of minim total process time mtpt
schedul disciplin to rotat storag unit when random arriv of
request is allow fix head drum and move head drum
and move head disk storag unit ar consid and emphasi
is place on the rel merit of the mtpt schedul
disciplin with respect to the shortest latenc time first sltf
schedul disciplin the result of the simul studi present show
that neither schedul disciplin is uncondition superior to the other
for most fix head drum applic the sltf disciplin is
prefer to mtpt but for intra cylind disk schedul the
mtpt disciplin offer a distinct advantag over the sltf disciplin
the comput requir of an algorithm that implement the mtpt
schedul disciplin ar shown to be compar to sltf algorithm
in both case the sort procedur is the most time
consum phase of the algorithm cacm juli 1974 fuller s
