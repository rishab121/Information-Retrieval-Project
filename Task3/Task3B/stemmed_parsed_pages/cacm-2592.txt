on gener of test problem for linear program code user
of linear program comput code have realiz the necess of
evalu the capac effect and accuraci of the solut provid
by such code larg scale linear program code at most
instal ar assum to be gener correct solut without ever
have been bench mark by test problem with known solut
the reason for thi failur to adequ test the code
is that rare ar there larg problem with known solut
readili avail thi paper present a theoret justif and an
illustr implement of a method for gener linear program test
problem with known solut the method permit the gener of
test problem that ar of arbitrari size and have a
