the logarithm error and newton s method for the squar
root the problem of obtain optim start valu for the
calcul of the squar root us newton s method is
consid it ha been point out elsewher that if rel
error is us as the measur of good of fit
optim result ar not obtain when the initi approxim is
a best fit it is shown here that if instead
the so call logarithm error is us then a best
initi fit is optim for both type of error moreov
us of the logarithm error appear to simplifi the problem
