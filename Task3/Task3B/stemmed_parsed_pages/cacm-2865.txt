verifi properti of parallel program an axiomat approach an axiomat
method for prove a number of properti of parallel program
is present hoar ha given a set of axiom for
partial correct but thei ar not strong enough in most
case thi paper defin a more power deduct system which
is in some sens complet for partial correct a crucial
axiom provid for the us of auxiliari variabl which ar
ad to a parallel program as an aid to prove
it correct the inform in a partial correct proof can
be us to prove such properti as mutual exclus freedom
from deadlock and program termin techniqu for verifi these properti
ar present and illustr by applic to the dine philosoph
problem cacm mai 1976 owicki s gri d structur multiprogram
