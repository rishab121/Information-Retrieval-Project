the class of iter formula obtain by ration approxim of
euler s formula is deriv with the correspond error estim
some histor note on iter procedur ar follow by a
deriv of euler s formula with the associ error estim
in a new notat which simplifi the error estim and
suggest gener the final section consid the pade approxim to
the euler polynomi and show how a number of known
formula mai be deriv from thi unifi approach there is
