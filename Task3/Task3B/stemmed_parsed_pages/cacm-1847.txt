an algorithm for find a fundament set of cycl of
a graph a fast method is present for find a
fundament set of cycl for an undirect finit graph a
span tree is grown and the vertic examin in turn
unexamin vertic be store in a pushdown list to await
examin on stage in the process is to take the
top element v of the pushdown list and examin it
i e inspect all those edg v z of the
graph for which z ha not yet been examin if
z is alreadi in the tree a fundament cycl is
ad if not the edg v z is place in
the tree there is exactli on such stage for each
of the n vertic of the graph for larg n
the store requir in creas as n 2 and the
time as n g where g depend on the type
of graph involv g is bound below by 2 and
abov by 3 and it is shown that both bound
ar attain in term of storag our algorithm is similar
to that of gotlieb and corneil and superior to that
of welch in term of speed it is similar to
that of welch and superior to that of gotlieb and
corneil testsshow our algorithm to be remark effici g 2
