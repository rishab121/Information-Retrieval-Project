automat gener of effici lexic processor us finit state techniqu
the practic applic of the theori of finit state automata
to automat gener lexic processor is dealt with in thi
tutori articl by the us of the a rword system
develop at m as part of the a 1 system
thi system accept as input descript of the multicharact item
or of word allow in a languag given in term
of a subset of regular express the output of the
system is a lexic processor which read a string of
charact and combin them into the item as defin by
the regular express each output item is identifi by a
code number togeth with a pointer to a block of
storag contain the charact and charact count in the item
the processor produc by the system ar base on finit
state machin each state of a machin correspond to a
uniqu condit in the lexic process of a charact string
at each state a charact is read and the machin
chang to a new state at each transit appropri action
ar taken base on the particular charact read the system
ha been in oper sinc 1966 and processor gener have
compar favor in speed to carefulli hand code program to
accomplish the same task lexic processor for a o and
mad ar among the mani which have been produc the
techniqu emploi ar independ of the natur of the item
be evalu if the word event is substitut for charact
string these processor mai be describ as gener decis make
mechan base upon an order sequenc of event thi allow
the system to be us in a rang of applic
outsid the area of lexic process howev conveni these advantag
mai be speed is the most import consider in design
a system for automat gener of a lexic processor the
goal wa a processor which complet elimin backup or reread
which wa nearli as fast as hand code processor which
would analyz the languag and detect error and which would
be conveni and easi to us cacm decemb 1968 johnson
