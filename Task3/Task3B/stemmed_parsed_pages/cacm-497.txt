further remark on line segment curv fit us dynam program
in a recent paper bellman show how dynam program could
be us to determin the solut to a problem previous
consid by stone the problem compris the determin given n
of the n point of subdivis of a given interv
a b and the correspond line segment that give the
best least squar fit to a function g x in
the interv bellman confin himself primarili to the analyt deriv
suggest briefli howev how the solut of the equat deriv
for each particular point of subdivis u i could be
reduc to a discret search in thi paper the comput
procedur is consid more fulli and the similar to some
of stone s equat ar indic it is further shown
that an equat for u i involv no minim mai
be found in addit it is shown how bellman s
method mai be appli to the curv fit problem when
the addit constraint ar ad that the end of the
line segment must be on the curv cacm august 1962
