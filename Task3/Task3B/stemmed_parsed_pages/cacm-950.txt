parallel method for integr ordinari differenti equat thi paper is
dedic to the proposit that in order to take full
advantag for real time comput of highli parallel comput as
can be expect to be avail in the near futur
much of numer analysi will have to be recast in
a more parallel form by thi is meant that serial
algorithm ought to be replac by algorithm which consist of
sever subtask which can be comput without knowledg of the
result of the other subtask as an exampl a method
is propos for parallel the numer integr of an ordinari
differenti equat which process by all standard method is entir
