a new approach to automat scan of contour map the
problem of automat digit of contour map is discuss the
structur of a gener contour map is analyz and it
topolog properti ar util in develop a new scan algorithm
the problem of detect and recognit of contour line is
solv by a two color label method it is shown
that for map contain normal contour line onli it suffic
to distinguish between so call even and odd line the
tangenc problem involv in practic scan is discuss and a
solut base on minim comput memori space and simplifi control
program is suggest cacm septemb 1972 mor m lamdan t
