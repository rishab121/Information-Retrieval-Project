a heurist problem solv design system for equip or furnitur
layout the design problem solver dp demonstr that the comput
can perform simpl design task in particular it design furnitur
and equip layout thi task wa chosen becaus it is
simpl well defin and characterist of mani design task in
architectur engin urban plan and natur resourc manag these space
plan task usual involv manipul two dimension represent of object
to creat feasibl or optim solut for problem involv topolog
and metric spatial constraint the paper describ extens test perform
on the program dp is a heurist problem solver with
a plan phase prefix to it it us the plan
process to give it a sens of direct diagnost procedur
to locat difficulti and remedi action to recov from difficulti
it us a convex polygon represent to accur describ the
object and the layout thi represent allow topolog and metric
constraint to be test and the design to be easili
updat dp ha been appli to 50 problem while it
is slow and limit in scope the idea behind it
ar gener it demonstr the need for select in control
