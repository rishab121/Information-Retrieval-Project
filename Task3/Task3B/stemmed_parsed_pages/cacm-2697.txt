a fast method for solv a class of tridiagon linear
system the solut of linear system have real symmetr diagon
domin tridiagon coeffici matric with constant diagon is consid it
is prove that the diagon of the lu decomposit converg
when float point precis it is also prove that the
comput lu decomposit converg when float point arithmet is us
and that the limit of the lu diagon us float
point ar roughli within machin precis of the limit us
real arithmet thi fact is exploit to reduc the number
of float point oper requir to solv a linear system
from 8n 7 to 5n 2k 3 where k is
much less than n the order of the matrix if
the element of the subdiagon and superdiagon ar 1 then
onli 4n 2k 3 oper ar need the entir lu
decomposit take k word of storag and consider save in
arrai subscript ar achiev upper and lower bound on k
ar obtain in term of the ratio of the coeffici
matrix diagon constant and paramet of the float point number
