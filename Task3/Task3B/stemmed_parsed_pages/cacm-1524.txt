a stop criterion for polynomi root find when search for
the root of a polynomi it is gener difficult to
know just when to accept a number as an adequ
approxim to the root in thi paper an algorithm is
present which allow on to termin the iter process on
the basi of calcul bound for the roundoff error which
occur in evalu the polynomi thi stop criterion ha been
test on numer exampl and ha been found to serv
as a satisfactori mean for accept a complex number as
a zero of a real polynomi cacm octob 1967 adam
