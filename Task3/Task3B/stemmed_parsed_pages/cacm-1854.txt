on multiprogram machin code and comput organ the author feel
that the interrupt featur which is avail in most modern
comput is a potent sourc of program pitfal and error
and that it therefor mai heavili contribut to the unreli
of program make us of it a program scheme is
present which avoid the concept of the interrupt and permit
the specif of concurr or pseudoconcurr activ in a supposedli
more perspicu manner it is intend to serv as a
basi for the construct of oper system which ar prime
exampl of program with concurr activ the scheme includ a
set of basic instruct for the gener termin and synchron
of parallel process a set of routin repres these instruct
and therebi simul a hypothet machin organ ha been implement
and test on the ibm system 360 two program us
