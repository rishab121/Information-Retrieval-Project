the simul of time share system the develop of new
larg scale time share system ha rais a number of
problem for comput center manag not onli is it necessari
to develop an appropri hardwar configur for these system but
appropri softwar adjust must be made unfortun these system often
do not respond to chang in the manner that intuit
would suggest and there ar few guid to assist in
the analysi of perform characterist the develop of a comprehens
simul model to assist in the investig of these question
is describ in thi paper the result model ha a
gener purpos design and can be us to studi a
varieti of time share system it can also be us
to assist in the design and develop of new time
share algorithm or techniqu for the sake of effici and
greater applic the model wa implement in a limit fortran
subset that is compat with most fortran iv compil the
us of the simul is demonstr by a studi of
