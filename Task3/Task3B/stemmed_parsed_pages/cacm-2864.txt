characterist of program local the term local ha been us
to denot that subset of a program s segment which
ar referenc dure a particular phase of it execut a
program s behavior can be character in term of it
resid in local of variou size and lifetim and the
transit between these local in thi paper the concept of
a local is made more explicit through a formal definit
of what constitut a phase of local refer behavior and
by a correspond mechan for the detect of local in
actual refer string thi definit provid for the exist of
a hierarchi of local at ani given time and the
reason of the definit is support by exampl taken from
actual program empir data from a sampl of product algol
