user to estim the effici of comput program ar present
the program whose effici on wish to estim is written
in the first languag a go to less program languag
which includ most of the featur of algol 60 the
second languag consist of interact command enabl it user to
provid addit inform about the program written in the first
languag and to output result estim it effici processor for
the two languag ar also describ the first processor is
a syntax direct translat which compil a program into a
symbol formula repres the execut time for that program the
sound processor is a set of procedur for that program
the second processor is a set of procedur for algebra
manipul which can be call by the user to oper
on the formula produc by the first processor exampl of
the usag of the two languag ar includ the limit
