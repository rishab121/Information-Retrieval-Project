an analysi of algorithm for the dutch nation flag problem
solut to the dutch nation flag problem have been given
by dijkstra 1 and meyer 3 dijkstra start with a
simpl program and arriv at an improv program by refin
both of the algorithm given by dijkstra ar shown to
have an expect number of swap which is 2 3n
0 1 and that these valu differ at most by
1 3 of a swap and asymptot by 1 4
of a swap the algorithm of meyer is shown to
have expect swap complex 5 9n cacm octob 1978 mcmaster
