the reconstruct of binari pattern from their project given the
horizont and vertic project of a finit binari pattern f
can we construct the origin pattern f in thi paper
we give a character of pattern that ar reconstruct from
their project three algorithm ar develop to reconstruct both unambigu
and ambigu pattern it is shown that an unambigu pattern
can be perfectli reconstruct in time m x n and
that a pattern similar to an ambigu pattern can also
be construct in time m x n where m n
