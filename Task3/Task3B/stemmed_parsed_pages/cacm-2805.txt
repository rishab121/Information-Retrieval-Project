perturb of eigenvalu of non normal matric the problem consid
is to give bound for finit perturb of simpl and
multipl eigenvalu of nonnorm matric where these bound ar in
term of the eigenvalu the departur from normal and the
frobeniu norm of the perturb matrix but not in term
of the eigen system the bound which ar deriv ar
shown to be almost attain for ani set of matric
