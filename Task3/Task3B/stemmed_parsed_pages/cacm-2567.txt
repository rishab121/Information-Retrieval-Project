an exponenti method for the solut of system of ordinari
differenti equat an explicit coupl singl step method for the
numer solut of initi valu problem for system of ordinari
differenti equat is present the method wa design to be
gener purpos in natur but to be especi effici when
deal with stiff system of differenti equat it is in
gener second order except for the case of a linear
system with constant coeffici and linear forc term in that
case the method is third order it ha been implement
and put to routin usag in biolog applic where stiff
frequent appear with favor result when compar to a standard
fourth order rung kutta implement comput time requir by thi
method ha rang from compar for certain nonstiff problem to
better than two order of magnitud faster for some highli
