analysi of the pff replac algorithm via a semi markov
model an analyt model is present to estim the perform
of the page fault frequenc pff replac algorithm in thi
model program behavior is repres by the lru stack distanc
model and the pff replac algorithm is repres by a
semi markov model us these model such paramet as the
inter page fault interv distribut the probabl of the number
of distinct page be referenc dure an inter page fault
interv etc ar abl to be analyt determin us these
model to evalu these paramet valu permit studi of the
perform of the replac algorithm by simul the page fault
