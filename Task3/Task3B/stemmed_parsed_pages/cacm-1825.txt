a practic method for construct lr k processor a practic
method for construct lr k processor is develop these processor
ar capabl of recogn and pars an input dure a
singl no backup scan in a number of step equal
to the length of the input plu the number of
step in it deriv the techniqu present here is base
on the origin method describ by knuth but decreas both
the effort requir to construct the processor and the size
of the processor produc thi procedur involv partit the given
grammar into a number of smaller part if an lr
k processor can be construct for each part us knuth
s algorithm and if certain condit relat these individu processor
ar satisfi then an lr k processor for the entir
grammar can be construct for them us thi procedur an
