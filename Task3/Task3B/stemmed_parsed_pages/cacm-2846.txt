compress tri thi paper present a new data structur call
a compress trie or c trie to be us in
inform retriev system it ha the same underli m ari
tree structur as a trie where m is a paramet
of the trie but wherea the field of the node
in a trie have to be larg enough to hold
a kei or at least a pointer the field in
a c trie ar onli on bit long in the
analysi part of the paper it will be shown that
for a collect of n kei the retriev time measur
in term of bit inspect of on kei is of
the order logm n and the storag requir of the
order n m log2 n bit thi improv in storag
requir and retriev time is achiev at the cost of
decreas the flexibl of the structur and therefor updat cost
ar increas first the c trie is analyz as a
data structur and then sever method of it us for
rel static databas ar discuss cacm juli 1976 mali k
data structur databas m ari tree trie retriev time storag
