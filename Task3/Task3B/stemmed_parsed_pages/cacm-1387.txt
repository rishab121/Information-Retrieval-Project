solut of system of polynomi equat by elimin the elimin
procedur as describ by william ha been code in lisp
and formac and us in solv system of polynomi equat
it is found that the method is veri effect in
the case of small system where it yield all solut
without the need for initi estim the method by itself
appear in appropri howev in the solut of larg system
of equat due to the explos growth in the intermedi
equat and the hazard which aris when the coeffici ar
truncat a comparison is made with difficulti found in other
