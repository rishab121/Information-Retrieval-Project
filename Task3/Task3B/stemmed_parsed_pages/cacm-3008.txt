preserv averag proxim in arrai programm and data structur design
ar often forc to choos between altern structur in store
these structur preserv logic adjac or proxim is usual an
import consider the combinatori problem of store arrai as variou
kind of list structur is examin embed of graph ar
us to model the loss of proxim involv in such
storag scheme and an elementari proof that arrai cannot be
store as linear list with bound loss of proxim is
present averag loss of proxim is then consid and it
is shown that arrai cannot be store as linear list
with onli bound loss of averag proxim but can be
so store in binari tree the former result impli for
instanc that row major order is an asymptot optim storag
