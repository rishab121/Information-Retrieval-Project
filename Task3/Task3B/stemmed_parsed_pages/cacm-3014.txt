the method introduc by burstal promis to provid a valuabl
complement to the more convent method the intermitt assert method
is present with a number of exampl of correct and
termin proof some of these proof ar markedli simpler than
their convent counterpart on the other hand it is shown
that a proof of correct or termin by ani of
the convent techniqu can be rephras directli as a proof
