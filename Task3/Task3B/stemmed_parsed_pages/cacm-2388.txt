optim binari tree grown with a sort algorithm item can
be retriev from binari tree grown with a form of
the algorithm quicksort in an averag time proport to log
n where n is the number of item in the
tree the binari tree grown by thi algorithm sometim have
some branch longer than other therefor it is possibl to
reduc the averag retriev time by restructur the tree to
make the branch as uniform in length as possibl an
algorithm to do thi is present the us of thi
algorithm is discuss and it is compar with anoth which
restructur the tree after each new item is ad cacm
