an algorithm for the construct of bound context parser an
algorithm is describ which accept an arbitrari context free grammar
and construct a bound context parser for it whenev such
a parser exist in the first part of the paper
the definit of a context free grammar and the work
of a bound context parser ar recal the notion of
reduct class for a context free grammar is then introduc
and it connect with the structur of a bound context
parser is indic next pushdown automata which gener the differ
reduct class of a context free grammar ar defin final
the algorithm is describ it essenti carri out an exhaust
studi of all possibl run of the pushdown automata gener
the reduct class in the second part the util of
the algorithm is discuss ed in the light of the
experi gain from it us in compil design the algorithm
is claim to be particularli us in the simultan design
of a languag and a compil for it cacm mai
