buffer alloc in merg sort a fix buffer alloc for
merg sort is present here which minim the number of
input output oper for a given order of merg when
sort on movabl arm disk the number of seek is
equal to the number of input output oper and the
seek time usual control the sort time first some standard
terminolog is introduc then the input buffer alloc method is
describ follow by an analysi of the improv to be
expect over more convent alloc thi analysi make us of
a particular distribut function an analysi of a complet differ
distribut is given which yield similar result thi suggest that
the result do not depend on a particular distribut function
an optimum output buffer size is also determin it is
conclud that thi buffer alloc can significantli reduc the time
of merg sort on movabl arm disk when the input
data ar not random and that thi output buffer alloc
should be us whether the data is random or not
