a parametr algorithm for draw pictur of solid object compos
of quadric surfac an algorithm for draw pictur of three
dimension object with surfac made up of patch of quadric
surfac is describ the emphasi of thi algorithm is on
calcul the intersect of quadric surfac a parameter scheme is
us each quadric surfac intersect curv qsic is repres as
a set of coeffici and paramet limit each valu of
the paramet repres at most two point and these mai
easili be distinguish thi scheme can find the coordin of
point of even quartic fourth order intersect curv us equat
of no more than second order method of parameter for
each type of osic ar discuss as well as surfac
