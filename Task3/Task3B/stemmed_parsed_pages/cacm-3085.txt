an o n algorithm for determin a near optim comput
order of matrix chain product thi paper discuss the comput
of matrix chain product of the form m1 x m2
x x mn where mi s ar matric the order
in which the matric ar comput affect the number of
oper a suffici condit about the associ of the matric
in the optim order is present an o n algorithm
to find an order of comput which take less than
25 percent longer than the optim time topt is also
present in most case the algorithm yield the optim order
or an order which take onli a few percent longer
than topt less than 1 percent on the averag cacm
