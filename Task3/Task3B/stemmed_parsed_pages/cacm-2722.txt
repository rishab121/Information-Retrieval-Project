multidimension binari search tree us for associ search thi paper
develop the multidimension binari search tree or k d tree
where k is the dimension of the search space as
a data structur for storag of inform to be retriev
by associ search the k d tree is defin and
exampl ar given it is shown to be quit in
it storag requir a signific advantag of thi structur is
that a singl data structur can handl mani type of
queri veri effici variou util algorithm ar develop their proven
averag run time in an n record file ar insert
o log n delet of the root o n k
1 k delet of a random node o log n
and optim guarante logarithm perform of search o n log
n search algorithm ar given for partial match queri with
t kei specifi proven maximum run time of o n
k t k and for nearest neighbor queri empir observ
averag run time of o log n these perform far
surpass the best current known algorithm for these task an
algorithm is present to handl ani gener intersect queri the
main focu of thi paper theoret it is felt howev
that k d tree could be quit us in mani
