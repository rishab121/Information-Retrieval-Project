effici string match an aid to bibliograph search thi paper
describ a simpl effici algorithm to locat all occurr of
ani of a finit number of keyword in a string
of text the algorithm consist of construct a finit state
pattern match machin from the keyword and then us the
pattern match machin to process the text string in a
singl pass construct of the pattern match machin take time
proport to the sum of the length of the keyword
the number of state transit made by the pattern match
machin in process the text string is independ of the
number of keyword the algorithm ha been us to improv
