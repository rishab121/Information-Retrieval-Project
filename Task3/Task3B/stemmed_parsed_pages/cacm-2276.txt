comput method for sampl from the exponenti and normal distribut
variou method ar known for transform uniformli distribut random number
into exponenti and normal distribut quantiti the most effici on
ar compar in term of memori requir and speed with
some new algorithm a number of procedur convert taylor seri
expans directli into sampl step an approach which mai be
us for sampl from ani continu distribut for the exponenti
distribut a definit recommend can be made wherea in the
case of the normal distribut there remain a choic between
slower and shorter algorithm and faster but space consum method
