on the applic of the process of equal of maxima
to obtain ration approxim to certain modifi bessel function the
second reme algorithm as origin establish for polynomi mai converg
or not when the approxim function ar ration howev the
few result known in thi domain show how effici the
algorithm can be to obtain approxim with a small error
much more than in the polynomi case in which the
best approxim can be veri nearli approach directli by a
seri develop the aim of thi paper is to investig
the limit of the applic of certain extens of the
algorithm to the case where the approxim ar ration as
well as to present some numer result cacm decemb 1966
