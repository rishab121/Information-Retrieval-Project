tridiagon by permut tridiagon a matrix by similar transform is
an import comput tool in numer linear algebra consid the
class of spars matric which can be tridiagon us onli
row and correspond column permut the advantag of us such
a transform includ the absenc of round off error and
improv comput time when compar with standard transform a graph
theoret algorithm which examin an arbitrari n x n matrix
and determin whether or not it can be permut into
tridiagon form is given the algorithm requir no arithmet while
the number of comparison the number of assign and the
number of increment ar linear in n thi compar veri
favor with standard transform method if the matrix is permut
into tridiagon form the algorithm give the explicit tridiagon form
