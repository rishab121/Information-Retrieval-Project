on comput the fast fourier transform coolei and tukei have
propos a fast algorithm for comput complex fourier transform and
have shown major time save in us it to comput
larg transform on a digit comput with n a power
of two comput time for thi algorithm is proport to
n log2 n a major improv over other method with
comput time proport to n 2 in thi paper the
fast fourier transform algorithm is briefli review and fast differ
equat method for accur comput the need trigonometr function valu
ar given the problem of comput a larg fourier transform
on a system with virtual memori is consid and a
solut is propos thi method ha been us to comput
complex fourier transform of size n 2 16 on a
comput with 2 15 word of core storag thi exce
by a factor of eight the maximum radix two transform
size with fix alloc of thi amount of core storag
the method ha also been us to comput larg mix
radix transform a scale plan for comput the fast fourier
transform with fix point arithmet is also given cacm octob
