a highli parallel algorithm for approxim all zero of a
polynomi with onli real zero an algorithm is describ base
on newton s method which simultan approxim all zero of
a polynomi with onli real zero the algorithm which is
conceptu suitabl for parallel comput determin it own start valu
so that converg to the zero is guarante multipl zero
and their multipl ar readili determin at no point in
the method is polynomi deflat us cacm novemb 1972 patrick
