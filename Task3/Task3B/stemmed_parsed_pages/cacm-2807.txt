on the stabil of gauss jordan elimin with pivot the
stabil of the gauss jordan algorithm with partial pivot for
the solut of gener system of linear equat is commonli
regard as suspect it is shown that in mani respect
suspicion ar unfound and in gener the absolut error in
the solut is strictli compar with that correspond to gaussian
elimin with partial pivot plu back substitut howev when a
is ill condit the residu correspond to the gauss jordan
solut will often be much greater than that correspond to
the gaussian elimin solut cacm januari 1975 peter g wilkinson
