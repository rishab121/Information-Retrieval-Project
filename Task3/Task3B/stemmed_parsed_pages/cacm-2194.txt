how to keep the address short an algorithm is present
for minim the sum of the length of the block
of code produc by an assembl or compil when 1
the length of each comput instruct is assum to be
either long or short long if the memori locat address
is more than a predetermin distanc from the current locat
short otherwis and 2 there ar block of instruct whose
begin origin ar separ by prespecifi amount for exampl some
comput permit either 8 bit address interpret rel to the
locat counter or full 16 bit address of all of
memori when assembl or compil two or more block of
instruct which have mani mutual refer in such a comput
there is no simpl iter procedur for keep as mani
of the address short as possibl thi paper demonstr that
a wide class of problem of thi type can be
formul as cover problem solvabl by mean of elementari arithmet
