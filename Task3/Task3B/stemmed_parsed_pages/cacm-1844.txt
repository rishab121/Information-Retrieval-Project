a modular comput share system an altern approach to the
design and organ of a gener purpos interact multitermin comput
system is present the system organ describ is a conceptu
simpl arrang of a bank of interchang comput each of
which is a memori processor pair that ar assign to
process termin job as thei arriv on of the comput
serv as the master or control comput and supervis the
collect and distribut of messag from and to the remot
termin in the simplest form there is a disk drive
for each connect termin a crosspoint switch network allow ani
such disk drive to be connect to ani comput thu
while each activ termin user occupi a dedic disk drive
he mai share the comput with mani other termin user
in a simpl manner the ratio of user to comput
is depend on both the size and power of the
machin us and the comput requir of the particular mix
of user thi system organ is inher a simpler and
therefor more reliabl approach to time share comput and ha
the potenti of a highli avail system at rel low
cost econom configur ar possibl for a rang of system
size that span at least on order of magnitud final
problem program develop by remot termin user can be run
on a dedic batch system if compat comput ar us
