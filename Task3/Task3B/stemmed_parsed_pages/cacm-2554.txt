reduct of a band symmetr gener eigenvalu problem an algorithm
is describ for reduc the gener eigenvalu problem ax lambda
bx to an ordinari problem in case a and b
ar symmetr band matric with b posit definit if n
is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth
the matric a and b ar partit into m by
m block and the algorithm is describ in term of
these block the algorithm reduc the gener problem to an
ordinari eigenvalu problem for a symmetr band matrix c whose
bandwidth is the same as a and b the algorithm
is similar to those of rutishaus and schwartz for the
reduct of symmetr matric to band form the calcul c
requir order mn 2 oper the round off error in
the calcul of c is of the same order as
the sum of the error at each of the n
m step of the algorithm the latter error be larg
determin by the condit of b with respect to invers
