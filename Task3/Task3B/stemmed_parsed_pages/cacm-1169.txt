an algorithm for minim backboard wire function a partial exhaust
algorithm is present for solv the follow problem aris from
automat layout of a comput given an order set e1
e2 en of n comput compon for each permut of
the element e1 e2 en there is attach a valu
of an integ function f the algorithm find a local
minimum of f by evalu the set delta f of
the increment correspond to a certain set of exchang of
two elementshen the exchang correspond to the least neg increment
of delta f is perform the process is iter and
stop when the set of the increment is a posit
or empti set which it is prove correspond to a
minimum the procedur is similar to the downhil method for
find the minimum of a real function f p and
can be appli to other placement problem experiment result ar
present with backboard form by mani element and differ initi
