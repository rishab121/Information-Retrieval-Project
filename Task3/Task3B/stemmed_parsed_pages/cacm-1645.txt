a note on comput approxim to the exponenti function two
method ar discuss which result in near minimax ration approxim
to the exponenti function and at the same time retain
the desir properti that the approxim for neg valu of
the argument is the reciproc of the approxim for correspond
posit valu these method lead to approxim which ar much
superior to the commonli us converg of the gaussian continu
fraction for the exponenti coeffici and error ar given for
the interv 5 ln 2 5 ln 2 and ln
