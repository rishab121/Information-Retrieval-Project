nonlinear regress and the solut of simultan equat if on
ha a set of observ z1 zm which ar bound
in a relat with certain paramet a1 an by an
equat s z1 a1 0 on frequent ha the problem
of determin a set of valu of the ai which
minim the sum of squar of differ between observ and
calcul valu of a distinguish observ sai zm if the
solut of the abov equat for zm zm n z1
a1 give rise to a function n which is nonlinear
in the ai then on mai reli on a version
of gaussian regress 1 2 for an iter scheme that
converg to a minim set of valu it is shown
here that thi same minim techniqu mai be us for
the solut of simultan not necessarili linear equat cacm juli
