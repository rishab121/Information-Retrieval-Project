a variat of the goodman lanc method for the solut
of two point boundari valu problem a recent publish method
for the interpol solut of nonlinear equat is improv and
appli to give a signific variat of the goodman lanc
method for the solut of two point boundari valu problem
the result method appli in particular to the numer solut
of optim control problem in the euler lagrang formul quantit
estim ar present which indic that the variat is nearli
twice as fast on some problem in the latter context
