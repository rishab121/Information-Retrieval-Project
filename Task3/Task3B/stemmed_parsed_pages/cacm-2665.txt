copi list structur us bound workspac two new algorithm ar
present for list structur copi us bound workspac the first
of primarili theoret interest show that without cell tag bit
the task can be perform in time n 2 the
second algorithm assum on tag bit in each cell deliv
attract practic speed ani noncycl structur is copi in linear
speed while cyclic structur ar copi in averag time less
than nlogn no foreknowledg of cycl absenc is necessari to
achiev linear speed a variat of the second algorithm solv
an open problem concern list structur mark that result demonstr
that mark can be done in averag time nlogn without
the aid of supplement tag bit or stack cacm april
