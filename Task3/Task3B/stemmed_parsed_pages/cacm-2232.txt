pattern width at a given angl that the pattern featur
width as a function of angl possess sever possibl interpret
is demonstr in thi paper which is a review of
the width concept in pattern recognit and the geometr concept
itself the object of the work is to clarifi how
the word descript can be made precis so that comput
algorithm for featur extract mai be obtain the focu is
on the theoret subject matter the result consist of a
set theoret definit of width at angl a theorem relat
it to the pattern boundari radiu vector and descript of

the set theoret width at angl is a us pattern
