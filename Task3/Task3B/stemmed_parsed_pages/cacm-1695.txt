plexu an on line system for model neural network a
descript is present of plexu a system which enabl a
user to construct and specifi a neural network to analyz
the output data produc by the network and to store
and retriev network and data from a librari the system
oper entir from a digit displai unit interact directli with
the user and permit easi and rapid transit between the
variou phase of the model process plexu is design to
complement neurophysiolog research so that the systemat develop of neural
model can be coordin with experiment work plexu network ar
built up from compon repres individu neuron extern stimuli and
interconnect fiber each compon be of a rel detail natur
provis is also made for the us of experiment data
as input to a network conveni mean for specif and
modif of a network and extens error check capabl ar
provid data result from the simul of a network mai
be analyz by a varieti of techniqu rang from exam
