global optim by suppress of partial redund the elimin of
redund comput and the move of invari comput out of
loop ar often done separ with invari move outward loop
by loop we propos to do both at onc and
to move each express directli to the entranc of the
outermost loop in which it is invari thi is done
by solv a more gener problem i e the elimin
of comput perform twice on a given execut path such
comput ar term partial redund moreov the algorithm doe not
requir ani graphic inform or restrict on the shape of
the program graph test thi algorithm ha shown that it
execut cost is nearli linear with the size of the
program and that it lead to a smaller optim that
