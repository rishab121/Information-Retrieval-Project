question then aris is a program properli construct so that
it oper and operand ar compat the activ of answer
thi question is usual call type check thi paper attempt
to isol the notion of type check and present a
partial solut to the type check problem base on the
notion of abstract and applic of function in particular a
program is map into an express within a decid subset
of the lambda calculu which character the type relat within
the program and elimin all other inform the determin of
the type wise correct or incorrect of the program is
resolv by reduc it correspond lambda calculu express to on
of two normal form the constant correct for a type
wise correct program or the constant error an applic to
type check in algol 60 is made and the attend
