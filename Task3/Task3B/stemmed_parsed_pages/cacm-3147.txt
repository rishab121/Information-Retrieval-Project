a model for autom file and program design in busi
applic system thi paper discuss a model for find an
effici implement of a busi applic system whose logic specif
have been determin in advanc the model view file and
program design as a problem of systemat coordin the configur
of dataset and comput it us a straight forward search
techniqu to determin aggreg of comput aggreg of dataset devic
organ and kei order for each data set kei order
for each comput and access method for each dataset comput
pair although comput result ar present for a sampl problem
involv 54 comput and 49 dataset the main point of
the paper is that the underli model work computation an
d is simpl enough to be adapt to mani file
