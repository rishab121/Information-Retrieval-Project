on the downhil method the downhil method is a numer
method for solv complex equat f z 0 on which
the onli restrict is that the function w f z
must be analyt an introduct to thi method is given
and a critic review of relat literatur is present although
in theori the method alwai converg it is shown that
a fundament dilemma exist which mai caus a breakdown in
practic applic to avoid thi difficulti and to improv the
