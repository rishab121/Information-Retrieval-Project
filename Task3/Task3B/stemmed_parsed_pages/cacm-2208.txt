storag util in a memori hierarchi when storag assign is
perform by a hash algorithm the util of storag is
studi in a two level memori hierarchi the first storag
level which is the fast store is divid into a
number of storag area when an entri is to be
file in the hierarchi a hash algorithm will attempt to
place the entri into on of these area if thi
particular area is full then the entri will be place
into the slower second level store even though other area
in the first level store mai have space avail given
the n entri have been file in the entir hierarchi
an express is deriv for the expect number of entri
file in the first level storehi express give a measur
of how effect the first level store is be us
by mean of exampl storag util is then studi as
a function of the hash algorithm the number of storag
area into which the first level store is divid and
the total size of the first level store cacm march
