a note on inform organ and storag sinc the logic
structur of a data base can be repres by a
tree or graph it is quit natur for us to
view the process of design a data base as that
of construct a tree or a graph a gener method
for construct such a tree or a graph is provid
there ar three import element in thi gener construct method
name a set of binari relat an algorithm for construct
subset of a set and an algorithm for select an
element from the given set of object the us of
differ relat and algorithm result in differ inform structur as
list tree ring etc thu the problem of inform organ
and storag is reduc to that of defin relat and
formul algorithm under a given set of constraint the result
present mai be valuabl to design as us design concept
and mai serv as a basi for develop a formal
