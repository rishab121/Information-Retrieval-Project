context sensit pars thi paper present a canon form for
context sensit deriv and a pars algorithm which find each
context sensit analysi onc and onli onc the amount of
memori requir by the algorithm is essenti no more than
the requir to store a singl complet deriv in addit
a modifi version of the basic algorithm is present which
block infinit analys for grammar which contain loop the algorithm
is also compar with sever previou parser for context sensit
grammar and gener rewrit system and the differ between the
two type of analys is discuss the algorithm appear to
be complementari to an algorithm by s kuno in sever
respect includ the space time trade off and the degre
