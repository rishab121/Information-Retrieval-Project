near minimax polynomi approxim and partit of interv a method
of near minimax polynomi approxim is describ as a by
product thi method provid a formula for an estim of
the maximum error associ with a given degre of approxim
us thi formula a partit algorithm is obtain for divid
a basic interv into subinterv for which approxim of equal
degre give equal maximum error cacm august 1964 fraser w
