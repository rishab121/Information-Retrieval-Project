further evidence for the analysis of algorithms
for the zero-one programming problem

the purpose of this note is to report computational
experience additional to that recently 
summarized by gue et al with two algorithms for the
zero-one linear programming problem  an error in 
gues paper is corrected  the utility of one of
the algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated
