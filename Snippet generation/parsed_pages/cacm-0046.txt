multiprogramming stretch feasibility considerations

the tendency towards increased parallelism in
computers is noted  exploitation of this parallelism 
presents a number of new problems in machine design
and in programming systems  minimum requirements 
for successful concurrent execution of several independent
problem programs are discussed  these requirements 
are met in the stretch system by a carefully balanced
combination of built-in and programmed logic  
techniques are described which place the burden of the
programmed logic on system programs supervisory 
program and compiler rather than on problem programs
