a new method for determining linear precedence
functions for precedence grammars

the precedence relations of a precedence grammar can
be precisely described by a two-dimensional 
precedence matrix  often the information in the matrix
can be represented more concisely by a pair of 
vectors called linear precedence functions  a new algorithm
is presented for obtaining the linear precedence
functions when given the precedence matrix this algorithm
is shown to possess several computational 
advantages
