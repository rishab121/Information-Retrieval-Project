reasoning about arrays

a variety of concepts laws and notations are presented which facilitate
reasoning about arrays  the basic concepts include intervals and their
partitions functional restriction images pointwise extension of relations
ordering single-point variation of functions various equivalence relations 
for array values and concatenation  the effectiveness
of these ideas is illustrated by informal descriptions of
algorithms for binary search and merging and by a short formal proof
