degree of multiprogramming in page-on-demand systems

a simple stochastic model is described which
offers a base for understanding the relationship 
between the number of programs permitted to share memory
the degree of multiprogramming drum traffic 
rates and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand
multiprogrammed time-shared computer 
systems  the model preserves as a key feature the
property of page-demand statistics which implies 
a burst of page demands at the beginning of any job
or quantum execution  the model a markov chain 
is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphically
for a wide range of key environment-descriptive 
parameters  implications of the results to time-shared
system design and programming are discussed 
and a calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming
for a wide range of parameters is presented 
graphically
