conversion of limited-entry decision tables to computer programs

decision tables are useful for describing a
set of complex decision rules based on given sets 
of conditions  algorithms that can efficiently convert
the tables into computer programs will extend 
the usefulness of decision tables to computer users
 two such algorithms based on work done by m s 
montalbano are described and extended here to handle
dashes and else-decision rules  the first algorithm 
minimizes the computer storage space required for the
resultant program the second minimizes computer 
running time during the conversion process both pinpoint
any contradictions or redundancies among the 
rules in a table
