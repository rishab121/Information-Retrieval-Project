a global parser for context-free phrase structure grammars

an algorithm for analyzing any context-free phrase
structure grammar and for generating a program 
which can then parse any sentence in the language or
indicate that the given sentence is invalid is 
described the parser is of the top-to-bottom type
and is recursive  a number of heuristic procedures 
whose purpose is to shorten the basic algorithm by quickly
ascertaining that certain substrings of the 
input sentence cannot correspond to the target nonterminal
symbols are included  both the generating 
algorithm and the parser have been implemented in rca
snobol and have been tested successfully on a number 
of artificial grammars and on a subset of algol  a
number of the routines for extracting data about 
a grammar such as minimum lengths of n-derivable strings
and possible prefixes are given and may be 
of interest apart from their application in this particular context
