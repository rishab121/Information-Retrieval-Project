median split trees a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys

split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions 
 a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys with 
respect to their lexical ordering between the left and
right subtrees  a median split tree mst uses 
the lexical median of a nodes descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed  unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees the cost of a
successful search of an mst is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values  further an mst
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree  a discussion of the 
application of msts to dictionary lookup for english is
presented and the performance obtained is contrasted 
with that of other techniques
