an efficient context-free parsing algorithm

a parsing algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general context-free 
algorithm known is described  it is similar to both knuths lrk algorithm 
and the familiar top-down algorithm  it has a time bound proportional to 
n^3 where n is the length of the string being parsed in general it has a 
n^2 bound for unambiguous grammars and it runs in linear time on a large 
class of grammars which seems to include most practical context-free
programming language grammars  in an empirical comparison it appears
to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up algorithms studied by griffiths 
and petrick
