is sometime sometimes better than always intermittent
assertions in proving program correctness

this paper explores a technique for proving the
correctness and termination of programs simultaneously 
 this approach the intermittent-assertion method involves
documenting the program with assertions that 
must be true at some time when control passes through
the corresponding point but that need not be true 
every time  the method introduced by burstall promises
to provide a valuable complement to the more 
conventional methods  the intermittent-assertion method
is presented with a number of examples of correctness 
and termination proofs  some of these proofs are markedly
simpler than their conventional counterparts 
 on the other hand it is shown that a proof of correctness
or termination by any of the conventional 
techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using
intermittent assertions  finally it is shown 
how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied
to prove the validity of program transformations 
and the correctness of continuously operating programs
