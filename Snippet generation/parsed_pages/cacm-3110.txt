assembling code for machines with span-dependent instructions

many modern computers contain instructions
whose lengths depend on the distance from a given 
instance of such an instruction to the operand of that
instruction  this paper considers the problem 
of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines
 an efficient solution is presented for the 
case in which the operand of every such span-dependent
instruction is either a label or an assembly-time 
expression of a certain restricted formf this restriction
is relaxed by allowing these operands to 
be more general assembly-time expressions then
the problem is shown to be np-complete
