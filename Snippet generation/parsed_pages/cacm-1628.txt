computer programming deals with an enormous
variety of activities and is carried on by people 
with a great variety of backgrounds  it seems clear

toward a distinct professional field but that the

economic social and educational characteristics are
as yet by no means well defined  in this paper 
these issues are examined and some opinions about them are expressed
