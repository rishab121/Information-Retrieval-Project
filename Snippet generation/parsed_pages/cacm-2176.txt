buffer allocation in merge-sorting

a fixed buffer allocation for merge-sorting
is presented here which minimizes the number of 
input-output operations for a given order of merge
 when sorting on movable arm disks the number of 
seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations
and the seek time usually controls the sort 
time  first some standard terminology is introduced 
then the input buffer allocation method is described 
followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected
over more conventional allocation  this analysis 
makes use of a particular distribution function  an
analysis of a completely different distribution 
is given which yields similar results  this suggests
that the results do not depend on a particular 
distribution function  an optimum output buffer size
is also determined  it is concluded that this 
buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time
of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the 
input data are not random and that this output buffer
allocation should be used whether the data is 
random or not
