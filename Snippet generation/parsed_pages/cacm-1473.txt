the stability of the fourth order runge-kutta
method for the solution of systems of differential 
equations

the problem of the region of stability of the
fourth order-runge-kutta method for the solution 
of systems of differential equations is studied  this
region can be characterized by means of linear 
transformation but can not be given in a closed form
 in the paper this region is determined by the 
electronic digital computer z22
