internal and tape sorting using the replacement-selection technique

a general technique for sequencing unsorted
records is presented  the technique is shown to 
be applicable for the first stage of a generalized sort
program the formation of initial strings as 
well as for sorting records within a memory storage an
internal sort  it is shown that given n records 
in memory storage records are sequenced using 1+log2
n tests per record that initial string lengths 
will average 2n for random input records and that reading
writing and processing can be accomplished 
simultaneously if the computer permits such overlap
