a comparison of error improvement estimates
for adaptive trapezoid integration

various simple choices of error improvement estimates for the trapezoid
rule are studied to demonstrate a comparison procedure which is
relatively independent of the profusion of adaptive search and stopping
strategies  comparisons are based on x^r ` the inclusion
of the noninteger powers makes this more realistic than the usual polynomial
based comparison  behavior near the singularity was found
to be the dominant factor and a new estimate based on a constant
curvature assumption and parametric differences was considered
slightly better than the other choices considered
