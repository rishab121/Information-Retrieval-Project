computing connected components on parallel computers

we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time olog2n  an
olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only n$n$log2n processors
the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure
of a symmetric boolean matrix  we assume that the processors have
access to a common memory  simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions
