the logarithmic error and newtons method for the square root

the problem of obtaining optimal starting values
for the calculation of the square root using 
newtons method is considered  it has been pointed out
elsewhere that if relative error is used as the 
measure of goodness of fit optimal results are not
obtained when the initial approximation is a best 
fit  it is shown here that if instead the so-called
logarithmic error is used then a best initial 
fit is optimal for both types of error  moreover use
of the logarithmic error appears to simplify the 
problem of determining the optimal initial approximation
