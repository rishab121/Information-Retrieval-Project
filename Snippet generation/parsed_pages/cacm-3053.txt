packed scatter tables

scatter tables for open addressing benefit
from recursive entry displacements cutoffs for 
unsuccessful searches and auxiliary cost functions  compared
with conventional methods the new techniques 
provide substantially improved tables that resemble exact-solution
optimal packings  the displacements 
are depth-limited approximations to an enumerative
exhaustive optimization although packing costs 
remain linear-on-with table size n  the techniques are
primarily suited for important fixed but possibly 
quite large tables for which reference frequencies may
be known op-code tablesspelling dictionaries 
access arrays  introduction of frequency weights further
improves retrievals but the enhancement may 
degrade cutoffs
