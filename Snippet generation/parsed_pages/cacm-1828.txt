synchronization in a parallel-accessed data base

the following problem is considered  given
a data base which can be manipulated simultaneously 
by more than one process what are the rules for synchronization
which will maximize the amount of parallel 
activity allowed  it is assumed that the data base
can be represented as a graph  an example of such 
a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on-line
file system  methods for synchronization of 
processes are examined their validity is
discussed and their performance compared
