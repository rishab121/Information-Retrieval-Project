detection of three-dimensional patterns of atoms in chemical structures

an algorithm for detecting occurrences of a three-dimensional pattern of
objects within a larger structure is presented  the search technique
presented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to define
characteristics demanded of candidates for matching this is useful
in cases where the properties of each atom considered individually
do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings
several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are 1 in pharmacology searching for a common constellation
of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities
2 in x-ray crystallography fitting a structure or a structural fragment
to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of
a fourier map 3 in chemical documentation retrieving from
a file the structures containing specified substructures
