a practical method for constructing lrk processors

a practical method for constructing lrk processors
is developed  these processors are capable 
of recognizing and parsing an input during a single
no-backup scan in a number of steps equal to the 
length of the input plus the number of steps in its
derivation  the technique presented here is based 
on the original method described by knuth but decreases
both the effort required to construct the processor 
and the size of the processor produced  this procedure
involves partitioning the given grammar into 
a number of smaller parts  if an lrk processor can be
constructed for each part using knuths algorithm 
and if certain conditions relating these individual
processors are satisfied then an lrk processor 
for the entire grammar can be constructed for them
 using this procedure an lr1 parser for algol 
has been obtained
