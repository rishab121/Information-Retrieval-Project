on the normalization requirement of
divisor in divide and correct methods

this paper presents an analysis on the normalization
requirement of the divisor in a divide-and-correct 
method  this analysis is made subject to the condition
that not more than one correction is required 
to obtain the true quotient character from the trial
estimate got from the division of a two-precision 
segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded
single-precision divisor  this segmented division 
is denoted here as a 2 1 precision basic division
 it is found that the normalization requirement 
could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors
provided the magnitude of the character next to 
the leading character of the divisor is known  if
however the normalization is to be eliminated one 
has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands
for the basic division  also considered is 
the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an
increase on the number of corrections on the quotient 
estimate got from a 2 1 precision basic division
 it is shown that such a scheme is economical only 
for small radices
