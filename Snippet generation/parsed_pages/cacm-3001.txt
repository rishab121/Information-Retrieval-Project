detection of combined occurrences

in this paper it is supposed that the variables
x1xn each have finite range with the variable 
xi taking on pi possible values and that the values of the
variables are changing with time  it is supposed 
further that it is desired to detect occurrences in which
some subset of the variables achieve particular 
values  finally it is supposed that the problem involves
the detection of a large number of combined 
occurrences for a large number of changes of values of
variables  two efficient solutions for this problem 
are described  both methods have the unusual property
of being faster for systems where the sum p1 +  
+ pn is larger the first solution is error-free
and suitable for most cases  the second solution 
is slightly more elegant and allows negation as well
as conjunction but is subject to the possibility 
of errors  an error analysis is given for the second
method and an empirical study is reported
