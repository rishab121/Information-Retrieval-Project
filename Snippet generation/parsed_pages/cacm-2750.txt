a cost oriented algorithm for data set allocation in storage hierarchies

data set allocation in todays multilevel
storage systems is usually based on qualitative 
ad hoc decisions  while it would be desirable to obtain
an optimal solution to this allocation problem 
it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes
it intractable to straight-forward solution 
 in such a situation we must find a set of assumptions
which simplify the problem greatly but which 
still provide a basis for considering all significant
cost elements this paper presents such a first 
quantitative allocation step  it considers many of the
significant detailed costs of system utilization 
data storage data staging and data migration  although
many avenues of further improvement are available 
the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate
as such it can aid in quantifying the problems 
of data set allocation storage system configuration and new device designs
