a class of iterative techniques for the factorization of polynomials

a method of iteration is developed in terms
of a function of somewhat arbitrary character 
 sufficient conditions are given for convergence of
the process yielding factors of arbitrary degree 
for polynomials in one variable  both lins method
and newtons method occur as special cases
