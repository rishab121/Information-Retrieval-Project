a program data flow analysis procedure

the global data relationships in a program
can be exposed and codified by the static analysis 
methods described in this paper  a procedure is given
which determines all the definitions which can
possibly reach each node of the control flow graph
of the program and all the definitions that are 
live on each edge of the graph  the procedure uses
an interval ordered edge listing data structure 
and handles reducible and irreducible graphs indistinguishably
