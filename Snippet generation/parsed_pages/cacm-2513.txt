a nonrecursive list moving algorithm

an efficient nonrecursive algorithm is given
for moving any lisp-type list  in particular 
the algorithm requires no storage other than the new
nodes into which the list is to be moved and no 
additional bits per node for marking the algorithm
runs in time proportional to the number of nodes 
in the list  the original list structure is destroyed as it is moved
