transition network grammars for natural language analysis

the use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis
of natural language sentences is described  structure-building
actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering
restructuring and copying of constituents necessary to produce
deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a
transformational analysis and conditions on the arcs allow for a
powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take
advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing  the
advantage of this model for natural language analysis are discussed
in detail and illustrated by examples  an implementation of an
experimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly 
described
