new sufficient optimality conditions for
integer programming and their application

the purpose of this report is to present a
new class of sufficient optimality conditions for 
pure and mixed integer programming problems  some of
the sets of sufficient conditions presented can 
be thought of as generalizations of optimality conditions
based on primal-dual complementarity in linear 
programming  these sufficient conditions are particularly
useful for the construction of difficult integer 
programming problems with known optimal solutions  these
problems may then be used to test and/or benchmark 
integer programming codes
