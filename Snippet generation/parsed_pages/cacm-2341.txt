blocks-a new data type for snobol4

a new data type called a block has been implemented
for snobol4  a block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string  the third dimension is used for
overstriking  blocks may be printed concatenated 
in any of three dimensions and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points  some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment  blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output  a variety of graphical problems including
flowcharting bargraphs logic diagrams 
mathematical-equation formation and text justification
and preparation have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way  in addition
to these somewhat specialized applications 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work  the concept of a block is largely
language independenthat is blocks require 
little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of 
most programming languages
