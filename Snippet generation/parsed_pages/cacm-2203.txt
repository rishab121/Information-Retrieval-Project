key-to-address transform techniques a fundamental
performance study on large existing formatted 
files

the results of a study of eight different
key-to-address transformation methods applied to 
a set of existing files are presented  as each method
is applied to a particular file load factor and 
bucket size are varied over a wide range  in addition
appropriate variables pertinent only to a specific 
method take on different values  the performance of
each method is summarized in terms of the number 
of accesses required to get to a record and the number
of overflow records created by a transformation 
 peculiarities of each method are discussed  practical
guidelines obtained from the results are stated 
 finally a proposal for further quantitative fundamental study is outlined
