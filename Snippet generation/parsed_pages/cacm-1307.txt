a lightpen-controlled program for on-line data analysis

this paper describes a technique designed
to ease the use of a data processing system by a 
person in particular a scientist who is intimately and
primarily concerned with interpreting the significance 
of data handled by the system  since such a person is
often unable to spend the time necessary to master 
a programming language it is essential that he be aided
in composing commands to the computer  in the 
system described the user is not required to learn
or remember the vocabulary of the language because 
the vocabulary is displayed before him onmenus by
means of a computer-drive scope  he selects the 
various vocabulary elements required by pointing with
the light pen  by use of a small unordered set 
of rewriting rules applied as a result of light pen
selections the user generates only syntactically
correct commands to the system  he does not have to learn
or remember the grammar  the program restricts 
the user severely in the particular language he can use
but the method for communicating with the program 
makes these restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining
 the program has been used successfully 
for over ten months
