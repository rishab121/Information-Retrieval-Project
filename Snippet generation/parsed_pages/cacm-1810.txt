is automatic folding of programs efficient enough to displace manual

the operation of folding a program into
the available memory is discussed  measurements 
by brown et al and by nelson on an automatic folding
mechanism of simple design a demand paging unit 
built at the ibm research center by belady nelson
oneil and others permitting its quality to be 
compared with that of manual folding are discussed
and it is shown that given some care in use the 
unit performs satisfactorily under the conditions tested
even though it is operating across a memory-to-storage 
interface with a very large speed difference  the disadvantages
of prefolding which is required when 
the folding is manual are examined and a number of
the important troubles which beset computing today 
are shown to arise from or be aggravated by this
source  it is concluded that a folding mechanism 
will probably become a normal part of most computing systems
