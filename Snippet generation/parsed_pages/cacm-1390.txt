a programming language is described which
is applicable to problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules  by this is meant that patterns
may be prescribed each being associated with 
a skeleton so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed  the conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton  the primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons  the advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively 
and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely
