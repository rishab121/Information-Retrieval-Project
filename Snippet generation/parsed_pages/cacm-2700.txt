reduction a method of proving properties of parallel programs

when proving that a parallel program has a
given property it is often convenient to assume 
that a statement is indivisible ie that the statement
cannot be interleaved with the rest of the program 
 here sufficient conditions are obtained to show that
the assumption that a statement is indivisible 
can be relaxed and still preserve properties such as
halting  thus correctness proofs of a parallel 
system can often be greatly simplified
