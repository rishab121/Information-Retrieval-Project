a very high level programming language for data processing applications

application development today is too labor-in tensive
 in recent years very high-level languages 
have been increasingly explored as a solution to this
problem  the business definition language bdl 
is such a language one aimed at business data processing
problems  the concepts in bdl mimic those 
which have evolved through the years in businesses using
manual methods  this results in three different 
sublanguages or components one for defining the business
forms one for describing the business organization 
and one for writing calculations
