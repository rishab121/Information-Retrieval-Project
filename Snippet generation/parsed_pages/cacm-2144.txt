on accurate floating-point summation

the accumulation of floating-point sums is
considered on a computer which performs t-digit 
base b floating-point addition with exponents in the range
-m to m  an algorithm is given for accurately 
summing n t-digit floating-point numbers  each of
these n numbers is split into q parts forming qn 
t-digit floating-point numbers  each of these is then
added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit 
accumulators  finally the accumulators are added together
to yield the computed sum  in all qn+n-1 
t-digit floating-point additions are performed  under
usual conditions the relative error in the computed 
sum is at most t+1/vb^1-t for some v  further
with an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions the 
computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy
 for example for the ibm/360 b16 t14 m63 
m64 typical values for q and n are q2 and n32 
in this case  becomes n  32,768 and we have 
t+1/vb^1-t  4x16^-13
