a computer analysis method for thermal diffusion in biochemical systems

in the thermal detection of rapid biochemical
reactions it is necessary to correct the temperature 
data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical
calorimeter  to handle the complexities arising 
from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating
layers a computer program was developed 
which gives the temperature distribution of the system
as a function of radius and time  this distribution 
is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates
the instantaneous chemical state of there 
action as well as the heat produced by this reaction
 the program is based on a direct statement of 
fouriers law of heat conduction and the chemical rate
equation to provide a bookkeeping law to follow 
the reactants and the flow of heat packets in such a
way that the computer continually stores the heat 
distribution  a computer analysis method is here regarded
as one in which the physical laws of a process 
are used explicitly in the program usually this results
in by passing much of the mathematical procedures 
conventionally used  the program was tested against
some known exact solutions of the heat equation 
and gave identical results and compared well with experimental
data of a known biochemical reaction 
 the construction of computer programs based on the direct
statement of the physical laws is a principle 
of general applicability which has been applied
to several other physical phenomena
