a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems

an encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key  this has two important consequences 1 
couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient
 only he can decipher the message since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key  2
a message can be signed using a privately held 
decryption key  anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key  signatures cannot be forged and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature  this 
has obvious applications in electronic mail and electronic
funds transfer systems  a message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number m raising
m to a publicly specified power e and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product n of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q  decryption is similaronly a different
secret power d is used where e  d  1 modp-1 
 q-1  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor 
n
