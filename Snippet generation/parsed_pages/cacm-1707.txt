generation of positive test matrices with known positive spectra

sufficient conditions are given for a real
matrix to be similar to a positive matrix  this 
result is used to construct a similarity transformation
which when applied to a particular upper triangular 
matrix yields a positive matrix with a preassigned positive spectrum
