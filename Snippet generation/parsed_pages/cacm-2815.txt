high-level binding with low-level linkers

an easy to implement scheme is described by
which a compiler can enforce agreement between 
complex data types in separately compiled modules
 the scheme is designed to work with any existing 
link editor or linking loader no matter how deficient
 obscure run-time errors caused by inconsistent 
usages are forestalled by static errors detected at linking time
