proof techniques for hierarchically structured programs

a method for describing and structuring programs
that simplifies proofs of their correctness 
is presented  the method formally represents a program
in terms of levels of abstraction each level 
of which can be described by a self-contained nonprocedural
specification  the proofs like the programs 
are structured by levels  although only manual proofs
are described in the paper the method is also 
applicable to semi-automatic and automatic proofs  preliminary
results are encouraging indicating that 
the method can be applied to large programs such as operating systems
