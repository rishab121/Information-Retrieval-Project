mechanization of tedious algebra-the
e coefficients of theoretical chemistry

a table of formulas for certain integrals
involving legendre functions has been constructed 
mechanically by a program which performed algebraic operations
 the formulas are all rational algebraic 
expressions in a single variable and were constructed
by a recurrence procedure  they are of interest 
in molecular quantum chemistry  trivial coding techniques
were used to write the relevant programs in 
fortran  the results were photo composed on a photon
s-560 system that was controlled by tapes which 
were punched directly from the computer output so
avoiding manual keyboarding transcription errors 
and keyboarded correction
