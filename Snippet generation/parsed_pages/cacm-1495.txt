solution of transcendental equations by series reversion

an algorithm is developed for expressing the
solution y of the equation fy  gx as a power 
series in x  x0 when f and g are given as power seriesand
the root y0 is known at yx0  the algorithm 
is illustrated for the equation y^y  x ie 1+yln1+y  ln1+x
