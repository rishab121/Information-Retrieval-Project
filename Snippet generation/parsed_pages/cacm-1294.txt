note on triple-precision floating-point arithmetic with 132-bit numbers

in a recent paper gregory and raney described
a technique for double-precision floating-point 
arithmetic  a similar technique can be developed for
triple-precision floating-point arithmetic and 
it is  the purpose of this note to describe this technique
 only the multiplication and the division 
algorithms are described since the addition-subtraction
algorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification 
of the algorithm in gregorys and raneys paper
