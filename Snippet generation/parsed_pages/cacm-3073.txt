communicating sequential processes

this paper suggests that input and output are
basic primitives of programming and that parallel 
composition of communicating sequential processes is
a fundamental program structuring method  when 
combined with a development of dijkstras guarded command
these concepts are surprisingly versatile 
 their use is illustrated by sample solutions of
a variety of familiar programming exercises
