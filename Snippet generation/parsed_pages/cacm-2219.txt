a policy-driven scheduler for a time-sharing system

the service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system can be characterized 
by a resource count sumwirij where rij is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and wi is the cost per unit of the
service  each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time  priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives  a scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service  overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service  the algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system and 
it has provided significantly better service to interactive
and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler
