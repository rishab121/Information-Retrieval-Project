some performance tests of quicksort and descendants

detailed performance evaluations are presented
for six acm algorithms quicksort no 64 
shellsort no 201 stringsort no 207 treesort3
no 245 quickersort no 271 and qsort no 
402  algorithms 271 and 402 are refinements of algorithm
64 and all three are discussed in some detail 
 the evidence given here demonstrates that qsort no
402 requires many more comparisons than its author 
claims  of all these algorithms quickersort requires
the fewest comparisons to sort random arrays
