an algorithm for minimizing backboard wiring functions

a partially exhaustive algorithm is presented
for solving the following problem arising from 
automatic layout of a computer  given an ordered set
e1 e2 en of n computer components for each 
permutation of the elements e1 e2 en there is attached
a value of an integer function f  the algorithm 
finds a local minimum of f by evaluating the set delta
f of the increments corresponding to a certain 
set of exchanges of two elementshen the exchange
corresponding to the least negative increment of 
delta f is performed  the process is iterated and stopped
when the set of the increments is a positive 
or empty set which it is proved corresponds to a
minimum  the procedure is similar to the downhill 
method for finding the minimum of a real function fp
and can be applied to other placement problems 
 experimental results are presented with backboards formed
by many elements and different initial placements
