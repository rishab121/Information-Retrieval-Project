a study of line overhead in the arpanet

the form extent and effect of the communication line
overhead in the arpanet are considered 
 the source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized  then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied 
 some measurements of line efficiency for the arpanet are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements 
are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network
similar results are derived for a recently 
proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system
