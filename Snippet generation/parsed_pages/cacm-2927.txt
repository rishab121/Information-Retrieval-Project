some new upper bounds on the generation of prime numbers

given an integer n what is the computational
complexity of finding all the primes less than 
n  a modified sieve of eratosthenes using doubly linked
lists yields an algorithm of on arithmetic 
complexity  this upper bound is shown to be equivalent
to the theoretical lower bound for sieve methods 
without preprocessing  use of preprocessing techniques
involving space-time and additive-multiplicative 
tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to on/log logn
and the bit complexity to on logn log log logn 
 a storage requirement is described using on logn/log logn bits as well
