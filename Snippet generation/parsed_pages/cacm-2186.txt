in this paper the ritz-trefftz algorithm is applied
to the computer solution of the state regulator 
problem  the algorithm represents a modification of
the ritz direct method and is designed to improve 
the speed of solution and the storage requirements to
the point where real-time implementation becomes 
feasible  the modification is shown to be more stable
computationally than the traditional ritz approach 
 the first concern of the paper is to describe the
algorithm and establish its properties as a valid 
and useful numerical technique  in particular such useful
properties as definiteness and reasonableness 
of condition are established for the method  the second
part of the paper is devoted to a comparison 
of the new techniques with the standard procedure of
numerically integrating a matrix riccati equation 
to determine a feedback matrix  the new technique is
shown to be significantly faster for comparable 
accuracy
