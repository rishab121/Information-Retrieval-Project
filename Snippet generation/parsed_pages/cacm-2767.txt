a comparison of simulation event list algorithms

four algorithms are considered which can be used
to schedule events in a general purpose discrete 
simulation system  two of the algorithms are new one
is based on an end-order tree structure for event 
notices and another uses an indexed linear list the algorithms
are tested with a set of typical stochastic 
scheduling distributions especially chosen to show
the advantages and limitations of the algorithms 
 the end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous
immediate replacement for the algorithm 
in use with current simulation languages  the most
promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept 
 it will require an adaptive routine before it can
be employed in general purpose simulatorsbut its 
performance is such that further study would be fruitful
