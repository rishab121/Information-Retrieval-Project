mixed solutions for the deadlock problem

mixtures of detection avoidance and prevention
provide more effective and practical solutions 
to the deadlock problem than any one of these alone  the
individual techniques can be tailored for subproblems 
of resource allocation and still operate together to
prevent deadlocks  this paper presents a method 
based on the concept of the hierarchical operating
system for constructing appropriate mixtures and 
suggests appropriate subsystems for the most frequently
occurring resource allocation problems
