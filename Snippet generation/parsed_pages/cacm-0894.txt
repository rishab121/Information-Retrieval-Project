an iterative factorization technique for polynomials

an iterative technique is displayed whereby factors
of arbitrary degree can be found for polynomials 
in one variable  convergence is shown to occur always
if a certain jacobian does not vanish and if the 
initial approximation to a factor is near enough to an
actual factor  the process is simply programmed 
and preliminary results indicate it to be well adapted
to use with digital computers  for factors of 
degree two the technique is similar to that of bairstow
the present method being somewhat simpler
