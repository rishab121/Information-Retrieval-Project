designing surfaces in 3-d

an experimental system for computer-aided
design of free-form surfaces in three dimensions 
is described the surfaces are represented in the system
as parametric basis splines the principal features 
of the system are 1 the surfaces are rendered as isoparametric
line drawings on a head-mounted display 
and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional
wand which allows 3-d movements of the points 
controlling the shapes of the surfaces 2 all of the
interactions with the surfaces are in real-time 
and 3 the mathematical formulations used assume no
knowledge of them by the user of the system  also 
examined are some of the features that should be part
of a practical 3-d system for designing space-forms
