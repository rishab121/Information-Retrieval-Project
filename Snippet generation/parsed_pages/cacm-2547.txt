representation of contours ad regions for efficient computer search

a novel computer-searchable representation
for the three basic pictorial features contour 
maps region coverage and line structures is described
 the representation which has practical storage 
requirements provides a rapid mean of searching large
files for data associated with geometric position 
as well as with attribute value  an application of this
representation to handling terrain information 
illustrates its utility  the algebraic properties
of the data structure make it computationally easy 
to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary
compute the area contained by a closed boundary 
generate the closed boundary representing the union or
intersection of two closed boundaries and determine 
the neighboring boundaries to a point and the
minimum distances between them and the point
