directed random generation of sentences

the problem of producing sentences of a transformational
grammar by using a random generator 
to create phrase structure trees for input to the lexical
insertion and transformational phases is discussed 
 a purely random generator will produce base trees
which will be blocked by the transformations and 
which are frequently too long to be of practical interest
 a solution is offered in the form of a computer 
program which allows the user to constrain and direct
the generation by the simple but powerful device 
of restricted subtrees  the program is a directed
random generator which accepts as input a subtree 
with restrictions and produces around it a tree which
satisfies the restrictions and is ready for the 
next phase of the grammar  the underlying linguistic
model is that at noam chomsky as presented in 
aspects of the theory of syntax  the program is written
in fortran iv for the ibm 360/67 and is part
of a unified computer system for transformational grammar
 it is currently being used with several partial 
grammars of english
