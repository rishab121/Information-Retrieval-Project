computers as an innovation in american local governments

computers and electronic data processing are
a major technological innovation in the operations 
of american local government this paper establishes that
there is substantial variation among the larger 
local governments in the rate at which they adopt computer
technology in the level of financial support 
they provide for edp and in the extensiveness and sophistication
of their automated applications  the 
central question addressed is what might explain the
differences between governments in the extent to 
which they adopt and use computers  hypotheses are
tested for several streams of explanatory factors 
using data from more than 500 city and county governments
 the findings identify certain local government 
milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levels
of computer innovation  somewhat unexpected 
findings reveal the significant impact of the distribution
of control over edp decisions and the dominant 
political values within the government other important
factors include the measured need for computer 
applications and the presence of external funding support
for computing  finally the paper suggests 
a framework for identifying the key determinants
of other technological innovations
