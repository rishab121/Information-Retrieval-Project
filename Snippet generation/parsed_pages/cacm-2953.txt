notes on recursion elimination

various methods of recursion elimination are
applied to the schematic recursive procedure 
proc sx px then nx sfx sgx mx fi  procedures
with this general form arise in connection 
with tree traversal and sorting algorithms  each method
of recursion removal involves the use of one 
or more stacks and the solutions are compared
on the basis of their running time
