a 48-bit pseudo-random number generator

a new 48-bit pseudo-random number generator suitable
for several computers was tested statistically 
for randomness to determine its adequacy for use in monte
carlo programs  frequency tests distributions 
of certain low-order moments runs up and down and runs
above and below the mean were applied to one-half 
million generated numbers lying within the interval
0,1 and to three sets of integers obtained from 
specified bits within the generated numbers  these
tests substantiated the randomness of all numbers 
except for the set of integers coming from the least significant bits
