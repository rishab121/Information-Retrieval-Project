symbolic execution and program testing

this paper describes the symbolic execution of
programs  instead of supplying the normal inputs 
to a program eg numbers one supplies symbols representing
arbitrary values  the execution proceeds 
as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolic
formulas over the input symbols  the difficult 
yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic execution
of conditional branch type statements  a 
particular system called effigy which provides symbolic
execution for program testing and debugging is 
also described  it interpretively executes programs written
in a simple pl/i style programming language 
 it includes many standard debugging features the ability
to manage and to prove things about symbolic 
expressions a simple program testing manager and a program
verifier  a brief discussion of the relationship 
between symbolic execution and program proving is also included
