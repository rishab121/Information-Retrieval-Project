a recurrence scheme for converting from
one orthogonal expansion into another

a generalization of a scheme of hamming for
converting a polynomial pnx into a chebyshev 
series is combined with a recurrence scheme of clenshaw
for summing any finite series whose terms satisfy 
a three-term recurrence formula
