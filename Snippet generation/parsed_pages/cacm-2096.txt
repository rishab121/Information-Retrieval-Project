experiments with the m  n tree-searching program

the m  n procedure is an improvement to the mini-max
backing-up procedure widely used in computer program for game-playing
and other purposes  it is based on the principle that it is
desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of
uncertainty  the mini-max procedure assigns to a max min node
the value of the highest lowest valued successor to that node 
the m  n procedure assigns to a max min node some function of
the m n highest lowest valued successors  an m  n procedure was
written in lisp to play the game of kalah and it was demonstrated that 
the m  n procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max
procedure  the statistical significance of important conclusions is given 
since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers 
on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field these experiments 
can perhaps serve as a model for future work
