a linear sieve algorithm for finding prime numbers

a new algorithm is presented for finding all
primes between 2 and n  the algorithm executes 
in time proportional to n assuming that multiplication
of integers not larger than n can be performed 
in unit time  the method has the same arithmetic complexity
as the algorithm presented by mairson 6 
however our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant
 it is also easily extended to find the prime 
factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n
