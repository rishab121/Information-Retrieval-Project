a model of memory contention in a paging machine

this paper is concerned with certain aspects of contention
for main memory resources in a multiprogrammed 
computer system operating under demand paging  in
the model presented the number of page-frames of 
main memory allocated to a problem program varies in
time  these changes in memory configuration are 
represented explicitly in the model cpu requirements and
page exception characteristics of program material 
being described statistically  expressions for the distribution
of the number of page-frames allocated 
to an executing program the long run expected fraction
of a programs execution time in a given number 
of page-frames and the average execution interval of the
multiprogrammed load are obtained  it is pointed 
out heuristically and demonstrated numerically that
an increase is obtain able in the average execution 
interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resulting
from equal fixed partitioning of main memory
