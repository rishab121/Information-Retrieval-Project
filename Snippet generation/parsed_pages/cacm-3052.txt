cold-start vs warm-start miss ratios

in a two-level computer storage hierarchy miss
ratio measurements are often made from a cold 
start that is made with the first-level  store initially
empty  for large capacities the effect on 
the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while
filling the first-level store can be significant 
even for long reference strings  use of warm-start
rather than cold-start miss ratios cast doubt 
on the widespread belief that the observed s-shape of
lifetime reciprocal of miss ratio versus capacity 
curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that
maintain a constant number of pages in main storage 
 on the other hand if cold-start miss ratios are measured
as a function of capacity and measurement 
length then they are useful in studying systems in which
operation of a program is periodically interrupted 
by task switches  it is shown how to obtain under simple
assumptions the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming 
from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtain
approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start 
miss ratios
