the simplex method of linear programming using lu decomposition

standard computer implementations of dantzigs
simplex method for linear programming are based 
upon forming the inverse of the basic matrix and updating
the inverse after every step of the method 
 these implementations have bad round-off error properties
 this paper gives the theoretical background 
for an implementation which is based upon the lu decomposition
computed with row interchanges of the 
basic matrix  the implementation is slow but has good
round-off error behavior  the implementation 
appears as cacm algorithm 350
