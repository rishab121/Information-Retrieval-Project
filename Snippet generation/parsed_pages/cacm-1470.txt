the structure of programming languages

the following are identified as major components
of every programming language 1 the elementary 
program statement 2 mechanisms for linking elementary
statements together 3 the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs  several alternative
forms of each of these components are described 
compared and evaluated  many examples frequently from
list processing languages illustrate the forms 
described  elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands requirements or implicit 
specifications  a command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken  a requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken  an implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect  subroutines may be entered
explicitly by execute call or by function 
composition  explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions  an execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language 
 function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call  the three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are 1 by referring to
the data itself 2 by referring to the data by 
a name and 3 by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions  names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts 
the author discusses advantages disadvantages and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language   he concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs organizing systems and referencing 
data
