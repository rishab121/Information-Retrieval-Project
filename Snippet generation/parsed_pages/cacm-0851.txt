design and characteristics of a variable-length
record sort using new fixed-length record sorting 
techniques

this paper describes the application of several
new techniques for sorting fixed-length records 
to the problems of variable-length record sorting 
the techniques have been implemented on a sylvania 
9400 computer system with 32,000 fixed-length words
of memory  specifically the techniques sequence 
variable-length records of unrestricted size produce
long initial strings of data merge strings of 
data at the power of t-1 where t is the number of work
tapes in a system and do not restrict the volume 
of input data
