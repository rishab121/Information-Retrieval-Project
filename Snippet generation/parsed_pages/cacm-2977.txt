the stage hypothesis and the s-curve some contradictory evidence

this paper presents the results of a study
testing the s-shaped budget curve of nolans stage 
model of computer development in an organization  research
on the data processing budgets of california 
counties fails to support the s-shaped curve or the use
of budgets as a basis for a stage model  however 
the results do not invalidate the concept of a stage
model  the analysis suggests an alternative model 
of budget growth and a separation between models of budgeting
growth and growth stages in the development 
of the computer resource
