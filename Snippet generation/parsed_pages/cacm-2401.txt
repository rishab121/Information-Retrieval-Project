on shrinking binary picture patterns

a parallel processing algorithm for shrinking
binary patterns to obtain single isolated elements 
one for each pattern is presented  this procedure
may be used for counting patterns on a matrix and 
a hardware implementation of the algorithm using large
scale integrated technology is envisioned  the 
principal features of this method are the very small
window employed two-by-two elements the parallel 
nature of the process and the possibility of shrinking
any pattern regardless of the complexity of 
its configuration  problems regarding merging and disconnection
of patterns during the process as well 
as the determination of the maximum number of steps
necessary to obtain a single isolated element from 
a pattern are reviewed and discussed  an analogy with a
neural network description in terms of mcculloch-pitts 
neurons is presented
