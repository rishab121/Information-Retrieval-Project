the augmented predictive analyzer for context-free
languages-its relative efficiency

it has been proven by greibach that for a given
context-free grammar g a standard-form grammar 
gs can be constructed which generates the same languages
as is generated by g and whose rules are all 
of the form z  cy1  ym m  o where z and
yi are intermediate symbols and c a terminal 
symbol  since the predictive analyzer at harvard uses
a standard-form grammar it can accept the language 
of any context-free grammar g given an equivalent standard-form
grammar gs  the structural descriptions 
sdgsx assigned to a given sentence x by the predictive
analyzer however are usually different from 
the structural descriptions sdgx assigned to the
same sentence by the original context-free grammar 
g from which gs is derived  in section 1 an algorithm
originally due to abbott is described standard-form 
grammar each of whose rules is in standard form supplemented
by additional information describing its 
derivation from the original context-free grammar 
a technique for performing the sdgsx to sdgx 
transformation effectively is also described  in section
2 the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing 
algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is compared
with two other parsing algorithms a selective 
top-to-bottom algorithm similar to irons error correcting
parse algorithm and an immediate constituent 
analyzer which is an extension of sakai-cockes algorithm
for normal grammars  the comparison is based 
upon several criteria of efficiency covering core-storage
requirements complexities of the programs 
and processing time
