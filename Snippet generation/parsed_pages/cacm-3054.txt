implementing quicksort programs

this paper is a practical study of how to
implement the quicksort sorting algorithm and its 
best variants on real computers including how to apply
various code optimization techniques  a detailed 
implementation combining the most effective improvements
to quicksort is given along with a discussion 
of how to implement it in assembly language  analytic
results describing the performance of the programs 
are summarized  a variety of special situations are considered
from a practical standpoint to illustrate 
quicksorts wide applicability as an internal sorting
method which requires negligible extra storage
