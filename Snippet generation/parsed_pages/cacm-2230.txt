a language for treating geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space

in this paper cadep a problem-oriented language
for positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional 
space is presented  although the language has been
specifically designed for the automatic generation 
of integrated circuit masks it turns out to be well
suited also for such other placement problems as 
architecture design urban planning logical and block
diagram representation  the design criteria 
the structure and the specific features of cadep are illustrated
