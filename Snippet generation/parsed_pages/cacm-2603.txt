the equivalence of reducing transition
languages and deterministic languages

the class of reducing transition languages
introduced by eickel paul bauer and samelson 
was shown by morris to be a proper superclass of the
simple precedence languages  in this paper this 
result is extended showing that in fact the first class
is equivalent to the class of deterministic 
context free languages
