a string language for symbol manipulation based on algol 60

an artificial computer programming language
is proposed for describing the manipulation of 
strings of characters and symbols  the concept of strings
introduced in the algol 60 report is extended 
by adding 1 the declaration of strings substrings
and string arrays with explicit lengths 2 the 
ability to concatenate and shift strings and 3 the
ranking of symbols for comparing stings in boolean 
relations  a primer or informal description of the
language is followed by examples a description of 
experiments with the language on an ibm 704 computer
and a formal description which taken with the 
algol 60 report defines the proposed string language
