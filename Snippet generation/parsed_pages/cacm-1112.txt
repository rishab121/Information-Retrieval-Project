a technique for computer detection and correction of spelling errors

the method described assumes that a word
which cannot be found in a dictionary has at most 
one error which might be a wrong missing or extra letter
or a single transposition  the unidentified 
input word is compared to the dictionary again testing
each time to see if the words match-assuming 
one of these errors occurred  during a test run on garbled
text correct identifications were made for 
over 95 percent of these error types
