abstract data types and software validation

a data abstraction can be naturally specified
using algebraic axioms  the virtue of these 
axioms is that they permit a representation-independent
formal specification of a data type  an example 
is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at
successive levels of implementation  the  major 
thrust of the paper is twofold  first it is shown how
the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify 
the process of proving the correctness of an implementation
of an abstract data type  second semi-automatic 
tools are described which can be used both to automate
such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate 
implementation from the axioms  this implementation
allows for limited testing of programs at design 
time before a conventional implementation is accomplished
