decomposition programming an analysis of matrix substructure 

a petroleum blending problem was analyzed in order
to compare the primal and primal-dual decomposition 
algorithms  in the course of the analysis a substructure
was discovered which has relevance to the 
relative performance of the two algorithms and to their
absolute performance as compared with a standard 
primal-simplex solution without decomposition
