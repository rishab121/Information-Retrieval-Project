an interactive computer system using graphical flowchart input

an interactive computer system operational on a graphical computer terminal is 
described  this system was designed to demonstrate a method of programming by 
computer interpretation of a flowchart  the user draws a description of a
sampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to a large
scale computer  the design is simulated and a graphic representation of the 
processed signal is returned to the scope  a successful design may require 
numerous modifications of the original design  a graphical interactive system 
provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and 
effectively
