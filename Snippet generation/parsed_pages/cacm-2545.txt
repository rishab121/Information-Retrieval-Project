a theory of discrete patterns and their implementation in snobol4

the notion of a discrete pattern is formalized
and certain properties deduced  a pattern is 
shown to be a generalization of a formal language 
algorithms for implementing the kinds of patterns 
in snobol4 are given  the general approach is to create
in-so-far as possible a bottom-up parse from 
a top-down specification
