creation and control of internal data bases
under a fortran programming environment

a method is described for the definition of a users common structure
and the automatic generation of the necessary common dimension equivalence
and type declarations for each of the users routines  the definition
for the common is contained in an easy to modify form thus
allowing the control of general communications of data between routines
the described system has been implemented on the ibm 7094
cdc 6000 series and the ibm 360  the method has proved to be invaluable
for the definition and control of common in many large-scale programs
