an exponential method of numerical integration
of ordinary differential equations

a formula for numerical integration is prepared
which involves an exponential term  this 
formula is compared to two standard integration methods
and it is shown that for a large class of differential 
equations the exponential formula has superior stability
properties for large step sizes  thus this 
formula may be used with a large step size to decrease the
total computing time for a solution significantly 
particularly in those engineering problems where high accuracy is not needed
