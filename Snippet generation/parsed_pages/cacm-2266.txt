a highly parallel algorithm for approximating
all zeros of a polynomial with only real zeros

an algorithm is described based on newtons
method which simultaneously approximates all zeros 
of a polynomial with only real zeros  the algorithm which
is conceptually suitable for parallel computation 
determines its own starting values so that convergence
to the zeros is guaranteed  multiple zeros and 
their multiplicity are readily determined  at no
point in the method is polynomial deflation used
