on the numerical solution of boundary value problems
for linear ordinary differential equations

a numerical method is presented for the solution
of boundary value problems involving linear 
ordinary differential equations  the method described
is noniterative and makes use of any one-step 
numerical integration scheme to reduce the problem from
one of boundary values to one of initial values 
 comments are made concerning some numerical results
of applying the method to a specific problem  in 
addition an extension of the algorithm described
to more general problems is discussed
