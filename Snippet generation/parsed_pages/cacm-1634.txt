from the inequality 10^8  2^27 we are likely
to conclude that we can represent 8-digit decimal 
floating-point numbers accurately by 27-bit floating-point
numbers  however we need 28 significant 
bits to represent some 8-digit numbers accurately 
in general we can show that if 10^p  2^q-1 then 
q significant bits are always enough for p-digit decimal
accuracy  finally we can define a compact 
27-bit floating-point representation that will give 28
significant bits for numbers of practical importance
