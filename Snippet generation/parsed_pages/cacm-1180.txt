axle an axiomatic language for string transformations

axle is a language designed for data manipulation
 data arranged in a linear form in a workspace 
is transformed according to a table of axioms called imperatives
 a transformation consists of a matching 
procedure which decides where an imperative is applicable
and a replacement procedure that modifies 
that part of the workspace  imperatives are applied
in accordance with definitions of symbolic terms 
presented systematically in an assertion table  the
process of definition includes the special case 
of recursive assertions  several complete programs
of imperatives are given to show a few applications
of the language
