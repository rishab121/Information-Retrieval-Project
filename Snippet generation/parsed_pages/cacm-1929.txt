images from computers and microfilm plotters

digital computers are widely used for the
processing of information and data of all kinds 
including the pictorial information contained in photographs
and other graphical representations  efficient 
conversion facilities for putting graphical information
into the computer and retrieving it in graphical 
form are therefore much needed  one of the most commonly
employed devices for obtaining permanent graphical 
output from digital computers is the microfilm plotter
 regrettably present models have no provision 
for producing images with a continuous gray scale or half tones
 in this note several programming techniques 
are described for obtaining half tone pictures from a
microfilm plotter under the control of a digital 
computer  illustrative examples of several methods are given
