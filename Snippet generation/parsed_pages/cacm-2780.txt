on computing certain elements of the inverse of a sparse matrix

a recursive algorithm for computing the inverse
of a matrix from the lu factors based on relationships 
in takahashi et al is examined  the formulas for the
algorithm are given the dependency relationships 
are derived the computational costs are developed and some
general comments on application and stability 
are made
