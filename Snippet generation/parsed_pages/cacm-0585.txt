initial experience with an operating multiprogramming system

the lewis research center has been using various
forms and degrees of program simultaneity 
in the operation of its modified sperry-rand univac scientific
model 1103 computer during the last five 
years  this simultaneity has evolved from an initial
achievement of self-searching input and output 
to the automatic time sharing of independently coded
problems  several important machine and program 
system modifications were necessary to accomplish this
evolution  several additional modifications 
although not required were added to facilitate ease
of coding and operation  all modifications had 
to proceed at a relatively temperate pace to insure that
the basic data-reduction work load of the computing 
center was completed on schedule  some educationally
valuable mistakes were made and their suggested 
cures often pointed the way to useful future improvements
or emphasized some of the basic principles 
of a multiprogramming system  the material that follows
is a description of the evolution of the programming 
and hardware system which has developed into the present
multiprogramming system at lewis research center
