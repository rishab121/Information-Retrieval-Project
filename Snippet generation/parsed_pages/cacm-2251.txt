weighted increment linear search for scatter tables

a new linear search for hash tables whose increment
step is a function of the key being addressed 
is presented  comparisons with known methods are given
in terms of efficiency and computation complexity 
 in particular the new method applies to tables of
size n  2^r  it allows full table searching and 
practically eliminates primary clustering at a very low cost
