characteristics of application software maintenance

maintenance and enhancement of application
software consume a major portion of the total life 
cycle cost of a system  rough estimates of the total
systems and programming resources consumed range 
as high as 75-80 percent in each category  however
the area has been given little attention in the 
literature  to analyze the problems in this area a
questionnaire was developed and pretested  it was 
then submitted to 120 organizations  respondents totaled
69  responses were analyzed with the spss 
statistical package  the results of the analysis indicate
that 1 maintenance and enhancement do consume 
much of the total resources of systems and programming
groups 2 maintenance and enhancement tend to 
be viewed by management as at least somewhat more important
than new application software development 
3 in maintenance and enhancement problems of a management
orientation tend to be more significant 
than those of a technical orientation and 4 user
demands for enhancements and extension constitute 
the most important management problem area
