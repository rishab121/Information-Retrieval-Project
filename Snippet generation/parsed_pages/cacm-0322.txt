operational compatibility of systems-conventions

the general standards committee of the share
organization has devoted considerable effort to 
the problem of operating a computer efficiently in
view of the growing number of programming systems 
available  each of these programming systems has been
coded to utilize a fixed set of hardware components 
without recognizing the fact that others may be occupying
a storage medium required by the first  these 
incompatibilities are currently resolved by manually setting
up the computer for each system as required 
 the following set of conventions is being considered
to minimize computer set-up time  they are of 
sufficiently broad interest that we feel other computer
users should be aware of them -george f ryckman
