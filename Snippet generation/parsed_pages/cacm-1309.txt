a computer user-oriented system

a computer language system has been developed
which makes possible fast preparation of management 
reports regardless of computational complexity or format
variety  costs are sufficiently low so that 
individually tailored reports can be prepared for every
manager  the system requires initial preparation 
of large data banks containing data in elementary form
 use of two special languages extract and matran 
permits selective extraction of any data subset efficient
processing through any computational sequence 
and flexible presentation of results in either tabular
or graphical form  matrix algebra is used as 
a fundamental vehicle for accomplishing both manipulation and computation
