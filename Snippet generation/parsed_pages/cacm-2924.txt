an interactive computer graphics approach to surface representation

an in teractive computer graphics method has been
developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary 
shaped three-dimensional surfaces  the method is a synthesis
of spline theory and algorithms an in teractive 
means for man-machine communication and software for
static or dynamic graphics display  the basic 
technique employed is a modified lofting method on
which sectional curves are represented by uniform 
b-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sections
by cardinal splines  among the features of 
this method are algorithms which enable in teractive
modification of the b-spline representation of the 
sectional curves  at all stages of the process the
spatial information is graphically displayed to 
the user  complex surfaces can be created by the combination
of a number of shapes that have been separately 
generated and automatically joined  the system has been
successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical 
routines for structural medical and graphical applications
