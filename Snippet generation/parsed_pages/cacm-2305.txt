the plankalkul of konrad zuse a forerunner
of todays programming languages

plankalkul was an attempt by korrad zuse in
the 1940s to devise a notational and conceptual 
system for writing what today is termed a program  although
this early approach to a programming language 
did not lead to practical use the plan is described
here because it contains features that are standard 
in todays programming languages  the investigation
is of historical interest also it may provide 
insights that would lead to advancements in the state
of the art  using modern programming terminology 
the plankalkul is presented to the extent it has possible
to reconstruct it from the published literature
