interference detection among solids and surfaces

in many industrial environments it is necessary to determine whether
r there is interference among components  there are many potential
interference problems in products made up of assemblies of components 
and in product manufacturing and testing  typically drawings
are used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences
but the two-dimensional static drafting medium does not always show
interferences among three-dimensional moving parts  this paper
 presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms
which carry out interference checking among objects so represented  
objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar
surfaces  two types of interference checking are discussed
detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detection
of collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories
