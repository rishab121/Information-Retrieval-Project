hierarchical storage in information retrieval

a probabilistic analysis is employed to determine
the effect of hierarchical storage organizations 
on information retrieval operations  the data storage
hardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of 
linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data
access times and increasing data storage capabilities 
 a system might for example consist of fast semiconductor
memory computer core memory extended core 
storage disk memory and data cells  equations are derived
to predict the effect of such a system on 
data access times using sequential files random access files
and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical 
linked lists
