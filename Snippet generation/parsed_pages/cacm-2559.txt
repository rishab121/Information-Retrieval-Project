the reallocation of hash-coded tables

when the space allocation for a hash-coded table
is altered the table entries must be rescattered 
over the new space  a technique for accomplishing
this rescattering is presented  the technique is 
independent of both the length of the table and the hashing
function used and can be utilized in conjunction 
with a linear reallocation of the table being rescattered
 moreover it can be used to eliminate previously 
flagged deletions from any hash-coded table or to change
from one hashing method to another  the efficiency 
of the technique is discussed and theoretical statistics are given
