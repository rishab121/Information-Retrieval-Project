efficient generation of the binary
reflected gray code and its applications

algorithms are presented to generate the n-bit
binary reflected gray code and codewords of 
fixed weight in that code  both algorithms are efficient
in that the time required to generate the next 
element from the current one is constant  applications
to the generation of the combinations of n things
taken k at a time the compositions of integers and
the permutations of a multiset are discussed
