experience with formac algorithm design

various facets of the design and implementation
of mathematical expression manipulation algorithms 
are discussed  concrete examples are provided by the
formac expand and differentiation algorithms a 
basic formac utility routine and an experiment in the
extraction of the skeletal structure of an expression 
 one recurrent theme is the need to avoid excessive
intermediate expression swell in order to minimize 
core storage requirements although many details from
the formac implementation are presented an attempt 
is made to stress principles and ideas of general relevance
in the design of algorithms for manipulating 
mathematical expressions
