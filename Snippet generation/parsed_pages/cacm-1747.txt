three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability input specifiability 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output  these criteria
imply that a user can if he desires either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computers output  to define 
the scope of the criteria the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock  the synchronization of parallel
processes protection in multiprogrammed systems 
and the assignment of capability indexes
