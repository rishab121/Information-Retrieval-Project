a study of storage partitioning using a mathematical model of locality

both fixed and dynamic storage partitioning
procedures are examined for use in multiprogramming 
systems  the storage requirement of programs is modeled
as a stationary gaussian process  experiments 
justifying this model are described  by means of this
model dynamic storage partitioning is shown to 
provide substantial increases in storage utilization
and operating efficiency over fixed partitioning
