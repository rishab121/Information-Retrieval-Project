sabrag a time-sharing low-cost computer

the serial sabrac computer designed and built
in the scientific department of the israel defense 
ministry has a 5000-location magnetic drum main store
 to avoid a need to resort to optimum programming 
techniques and to increase its overall efficiency the
computer has also been given a 224-word ferrite 
core store from which the program is obeyed  transfers
between the core and drum stores and to and from 
the twin paper-tape input and output channels are all
available autonomously concurrently time-shared 
 multiplication and division orders are also autonomous
so that the machine may be executing up to three 
orders simultaneously  all functions naturally are interlocked
 a number of other advanced orders and 
facilities are also incorporatedn particular an
execute order permits a temporary jump for up 
to four orders and a second modifier register permits double
modification in general and relative addressing 
of subroutines in particular  thus the overall effective
speed of the machine is muchhigher than its 
basic specification would lead one to expect and its
design indicates one way in which the concepts of 
time sharing may be incorporated in low-cost computers
