the structure of yet another algol compiler

a high-speed top down method of syntax analysis
which completely eliminates back-up of 
the source string has been implemented in a convenient
macro-language  a technique of  simulation at 
compile time of the use of a conventional run-time stack
enables the generation of code for expressions 
which minimizes stores fetches and stack-pointer motion
at run time while properly trating recursion 
and side effects of procedures  block structure and
recursion are handled without need for interpretive 
methods at run times  the context problem in the transmission
to recursive procedures of parameters 
called by name is solved in a manner which permits the
handling of the common cases of simple expressions 
and array identifiers with particular efficiency
