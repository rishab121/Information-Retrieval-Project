automast automatic mathematical analysis and symbolic translation

a procedure for numerically solving systems
of ordinary differential equation is shown to also 
generate symbolic solutions  the procedure is based
on a finite taylor series expansion that includes 
an estimate of the error in the final result  a computer
program is described that reads in a system 
of such equations and then generates the expansions
for all of the dependent variables the expansions 
are determined symbolically hence any non-numeric parameters
in the original equations are carried automatically 
into the final expansions  thus the exact influence
of any parameters on the problem solution can be 
easily displayed
