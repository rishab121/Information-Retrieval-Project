a general-purpose display processing and tutorial system

adept a display-expedited processing and tutorial
system is described  this system was designed 
to improve man-computer communications by employing
a display unit to interleave tutoring with other 
computer operations such as simulation programming and
information retrieval  it is written in fortran 
iv g for the ibm system/360 model 40 and the ibm 2250
display unit under operating system/360  adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs  it expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students teachers
and other users the full resources system-cataloged 
programs of the operating system  language processors
and compilers simulation models mathematical 
solution techniques stored data and all other library and
user programs can be incorporated into instructional 
material without reprogramming  illustrations of the various
applications are presented and their implications 
are discussed
