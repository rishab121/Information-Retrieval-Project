segment sizes and lifetimes in algol 60 programs

the characteristics of the virtual memory requirements
of a sample of algol 60 programs have 
been measured  distributions are presented for thesizes
of memory requests and for their holding times 
lifetimes  the results are presented in terms of johnstons
contour model and a simple abstract machine 
 they provide new empirical evidence of certain aspects
of the construction and behavior of real programs 
and some of their implications for the design of virtual
memory systems are presented and discussed
