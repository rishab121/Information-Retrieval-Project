interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers one by hansen and one by
hansen and r r smith have shown how interval 
arithmetic i can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r r smith is compared
with straightforward use of i in determinant 
evaluation  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i for determinant evaluation  an application using
i determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented
