a marovian model of the university of michigan executive system

a mathematical model of a computers executive
system is postulated and its parameters estimated 
with the aid of extensive data on the systems operation
 although simplifying assumptions are made 
the results predicted by the model agree reasonable well
with actual results  the model is used to study 
the effects of changes in the executive system and
in one of its compilers  further applications of 
the model are discussed
