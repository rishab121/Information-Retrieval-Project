a computer generated aid for cluster analysis

a computer generated graphic method which
can be used in conjunction with any hierarchical 
scheme of cluster analysis is described and illustrated
 the graphic principle used is the representation 
of the elements of a data matrix of similarities or dissimilarities
by computer printed symbols of character 
overstrikes of various shades of darkness where a
dark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity 
 the plots applied to a data matrix before clustering
and to the rearranged matrix after clustering 
show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any
distinctive clusters  a well-known set of data 
consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests
is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings 
by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis
