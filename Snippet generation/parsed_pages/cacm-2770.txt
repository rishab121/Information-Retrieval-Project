the quadratic hash method when the table size is not a prime number

previous work on quadratic hash methods is
limited mainly to the case where the table size 
is a prime number  here certain results are derived for
composite numbers  it is shown that all composite 
numbers containing at least the square of one of the component
primes have full-period integer-coefficient 
quadratic hash functions
