regular expression search algorithm

a method for locating specific character strings
embedded in character text is described and 
an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler
is discussed  the compiler accepts a regular 
expression as source language and produces an ibm 7094
program as object language  the object program 
then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces
a signal every time an embedded string in 
the text matches the given regular expression  examples
problems and solution are also presented
