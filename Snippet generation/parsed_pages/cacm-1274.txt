on the numerical solution of an n-point boundary
value problem for linear ordinary differential 
equations

a method for the numerical solution of then-point
boundary value problem for homogeneous linear 
ordinary differential equations is developed  the
method requires two runge-kutta integrations over 
the interval under consideration and the solution of
a linear system of equations with n-1 unknowns
