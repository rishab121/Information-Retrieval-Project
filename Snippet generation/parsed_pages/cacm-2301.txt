are similar to van wijngaardens two-level grammars 
used in the definition of algol 68  affix grammars are shown
by koster to be equal in power to van wijngaarden 
grammars  they are much more suited to parsing than
are the latter however  koster the inventor of 
affix based on recursive procedures  this paper presents
a bottom-up scheme for parsing them based 
on an extension of floyd production language fpl  included
is an algorithm similar to that of deremers 
for converting a large class of affix grammars into fpl
 the paper concludes by discussing briefly the 
applicabilities of the conversion algorithm and affix
grammars in general and some possible extensions 
to kosters definition of affix grammars
