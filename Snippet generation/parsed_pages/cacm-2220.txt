conversion of limited-entry decision tables to computer
programs-a proposed modification to pollacks 
algorithm

pollack has proposed an algorithm for converting
decision tables into flowcharts which minimize 
subsequent execution time when compiled into a computer
program  two modifications of this algorithm 
are proposed  the first relies on shannons noiseless
coding theorem and the communications concept 
of entropy but does not completely test the else rule
 the second modification completely tests the 
else rule but results in more executions than the first modification
 both modifications result in modification 
guarantees a globally optimal solution
