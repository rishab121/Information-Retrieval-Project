an experiment in a user-oriented computer system

a version of a software-hardware system for
the purpose of facilitating the programming and 
analysis of well-formulated problems is described  a modified
flexowriter is used to generate computer-acceptable 
input when equations or computable requests are typed
in much the same manner as they would appear in 
conventional mathematical texts  the typing and language
rules are quite flexible and unrestrictive 
 while the compiler part is efficient the system as
a whole has much broader aspects as a tool for the 
study of problem solving and self-teaching systems
