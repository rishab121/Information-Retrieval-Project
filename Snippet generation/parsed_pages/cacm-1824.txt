aparel-a parse-request language

aparel is described this language is an extension
to an algorithmic language pl/i that provides 
the pattern-matching capabilities normally found only
in special purpose languages such as snobol4 and 
tmg  this capability is provided through parse-requests
stated in a bnf-like format  these parse-requests 
form their own programming language with special sequencing
rules  upon successfully completing a parse-request 
an associated piece of pl/i code is executed  this
code has available for use as normal pl/i strings 
the various pieces at all levels of the parse  it
also has available as normal pl/i variables the
information concerning which of the various alternatives
were successful  convenient facilities for 
multiple input-output streams the initiation of sequences
of parse-requests as a subroutine and parse-time 
semantic checks are also included  aparel has proven convenient
 in building a powerful syntax and function 
macro system an algebraic language preprocessor debugging
system an on-line command parser a translator 
for dataless programming and as a general string manipulator
