a modification of efroymsons technique for stepwise regression analysis

the computational technique conventionally used
for stepwise multiple linear regression requires 
the storage of an n x n matrix of data  when the number
of variables n is large this requirement 
taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery
 the near symmetry of the matrices involved permits 
a modification requiring only half the storage and computations
of the conventional algorithm and this 
additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing
more variables  alternatively it permits 
the analysis of problems containing the same number
of variables but with all computations performed 
in double precision
