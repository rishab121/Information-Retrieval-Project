operations on sparse relations

various computations on relations boolean matrices
or directed graphs such as the computation 
of precedence relations for a context-free grammar can be
done by a practical algorithm that is asymptotically 
faster than those in common use  for example how to compute
operator precedence or wirth-weber precedence 
relations in on^2 steps is shown as well as how to
compute linear precedence functions in on^2 steps 
is shown as well as how to compute linear precedence
functions in on steps where n is the size of 
a grammer  the heart of the algorithms is a general
theorem giving sufficient conditions under which 
an expression whose operands are sparse relations and
whose operators are composition transitive closure 
union and inverse can be computed efficiently
