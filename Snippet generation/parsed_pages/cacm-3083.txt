pseudochaining in hash tables

this paper presents pseudochaining as a new
collision-resolution method  pseudochaining is 
half way between open addressing and chaining  it owes
its name to the fact that link fields are present 
in each cell of the hash table which permits chaining
of the first overflow items in the table  the 
efficiency of the method is derived and a tradeoff analysis is given
