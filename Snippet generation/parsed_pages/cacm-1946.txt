vs collins reduced p algorithm

algorithms for computing the resultant of two
polynomials in several variables a key repetitive 
step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
equations by elimination are studied  determining 
the best algorithm for computer implementation depends
upon the extent to which extraneous factors are 
introduced the extent of propagation of errors caused by
truncation of real coefficients memory requirements 
and computing speed  preliminary considerations narrow
the choice of the best algorithm to bezouts 
determinant and collins reduced polynomial remainder sequence
prs algorithm  detailed tests performed 
on sample problems conclusively show that bezouts determinant
is superior in all respects except for 
univariate polynomials in which case collins reduced
prs algorithm is somewhat faster  in particular 
bezouts determinant proves to be strikingly superior in
numerical accuracy displaying excellent stability 
with regard to round-off errors results of tests are reported in detail
