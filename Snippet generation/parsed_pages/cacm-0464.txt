syntactic analysis by digital computer

this paper provides an account of the shadow
language that is used to describe syntax and of 
a corresponding subroutine that enables a computer
to perform syntactic analysis  the input to this 
subroutine consists of a string to be analyzed and a
description of the syntax that is to be used  the 
syntax is expressed in the shadow language  the output
consists of a trace table that expresses the 
results of the syntactic analysis in a tabular form  several
versions of the subroutine and some associated 
programs have been in use now for over three years  the
present account of the language and the subroutine 
contains a summary of material that has been described
previously in unpublished reports and also some 
additional discussion of the work in relation to the more
general questions of problem-oriented languages 
and string transformations
