algorithms to reveal properties of floating-point arithmetic

two algorithms are presented in the form of
fortran subroutines  each subroutine computes 
the radix and number of digits of the floating-point
numbers and whether rounding or chopping is done 
by the machine on which it is run  the methods are
shown to work on any reasonable floating-point 
computer
