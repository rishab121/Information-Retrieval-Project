simple lrk grammars

a class of context-free grammars called the
simple lrk or slrk grammars is defined 
 this class has been shown to include weak precedence
and simple precedence grammars as proper subsets 
 how to construct parsers for the slrk grammars is
also shown  these parser-construction techniques 
are extendible to cover all of the lrk grammars of
knuth they have been implemented and by direct 
comparison proved to be superior to precedence techniques
not only in the range of grammars covered 
but also in the speed of parser construction and
in the size and speed of the resulting parsers
