computing capabilities at western european universities

this report on the authors trip to universities
in western europe in the summer of 1966 gives 
brief descriptions of computing activities at each institution
visited  present equipment capabilities 
vary from moderate to large scale however many institutions
plan to acquire complex time-shared systems 
in the near future  in the authors opinion the state
of the art lags behind that on this continent 
 this lag is attributed to four principal factors a
the handicapping organization of academic procedures 
b the university-government financial relationship
c the subordinated organization of the computing 
facility d the paucity of professional interchange
of knowledge  the effects of these constraints 
are explicated
