a comparison of tree-balancing algorithms

several algorithms-height-balance ie avl
and extensions weight-balance ie bb and wb 
and total restructuring-for building balanced binary search
trees are compared  the criteria for comparison 
encompass theoretical aspects eg path lengths and implementation
independent and machine/algorithm-dependent 
measures eg run time  a detailed analysis of code is
also presented at a level believed to be language-and 
compiler-independent  the quality of the resulting
trees and the overhead spent on building them are 
analyzed and some guidelines are given for an efficient
use of the methods  if insertion and subsequent 
queries are the only operations of in terest then pure
avl trees present the overall best qualities
