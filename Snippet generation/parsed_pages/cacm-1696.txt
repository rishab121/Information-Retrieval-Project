an algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchains
and transient states of a stochastic matrix

an algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchains
and transient states of a stochastic matrix
is presented  applications in markov renewal programming
and in the construction of variable length 
codes are reviewed and an updating procedure for dealing
with certain sequences of stochastic matrices 
is discussed  computation times are investigated experimentally
and compared with those of another recently 
propose method
