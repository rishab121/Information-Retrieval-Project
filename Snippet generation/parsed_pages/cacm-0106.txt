a method for overlapping and erasure of lists

an important property of the newell-shaw-simon
scheme for computer storage of lists is that 
data having multiple occurrences need not be stored
at more than one place in the computer  that is 
lists may be overlapped  unfortunately overlapping
poses a problem for subsequent erasure  given 
a list that is no longer needed it is desired to erase
just those parts that do not overlap other lists 
 in lisp mccarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solution
to the problem  the present paper describes 
a general method which enables efficient erasure  the
method employs interspersed reference counts to 
describe the extent of the overlapping
