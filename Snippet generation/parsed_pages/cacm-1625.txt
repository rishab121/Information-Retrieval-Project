on the automatic simplification of source-language programs

methods of simplification that can be applied
automatically to programs written in an algol-like 
language are discussed  the simplifications are based
on the form of the program and the knowledge obtained 
by a processor without any understanding of what the
program is supposed to do  these methods have 
been implemented in a processor called sure that accepts
a program written in jovial and outputs an equivalent 
jovial program that may be shorter and may be executed
faster than the original  sure is described 
some of the problems encountered in automatic improvement
at the source-language level are discussed 
and further types of automatic program improvement are suggested
