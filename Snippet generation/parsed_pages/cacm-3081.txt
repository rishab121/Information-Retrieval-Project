shallow binding in lisp 1.5

shallow binding is a scheme which allows the
value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded 
amount of computation  an elegant model for shallow binding
in  lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching 
is an environment tree transformation called rerooting
 rerooting is completely general and reversible 
and is optional in the sense that a lisp 1.5 interpreter
will operate correctly whether or not rerooting 
is invoked one very context change   since rerooting
leaves assoc v a invariant for all variables 
v and all environments a the programmer can have access
to a rerooting primitive shallow which gives 
him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or
deep and which affects only the speed of execution 
of a program not its semantics  in addition multiple
processes can be active in the same environment 
structure so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation
 finally the concept of rerooting is shown 
to combine the concept of shallow binding in lisp with
dijkstras display for algol and hence is a general 
model for shallow binding
