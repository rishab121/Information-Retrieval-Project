use of transition matrices in compiling

an algorithms is described which constructs
from a suitable bnf grammar an efficient left-right 
recognizer for sentences of the corresponding language
 the type of recognizer used in a number of 
compilers operates with a pushdown stack and with
a transition matrix  two examples illustrate how 
such recognizers may be used effectively for other
purposes besides the usual syntax checking
