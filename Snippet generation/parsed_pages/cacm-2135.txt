rapid computation of general interpolation
formulas and mechanical quadrature rules

let f have n continuous on a closed interval
ab and let l be a linear functional  the attempt 
is made to approximate l f with l q where q is a polynomial
approximating f  algorithms are developed 
for rapid computation of l q for a wide class of
selections of q which includes the lagrangian and 
hermitian rules as special cases
