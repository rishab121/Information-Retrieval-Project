syntax-directed least-errors analysis for
context-free languages a practical approach

a least-errors recognizer is developed informally
using the well-known recognizer of earley 
along with elements of bellmans dynamic programming
 the analyzer takes a general class of context-free 
grammars as drivers and any finite string as input
 recognition consists of a least-errors count for 
a corrected version of the input relative to the driver
grammar the algorithm design emphasizes practical 
aspects which help in programming it
