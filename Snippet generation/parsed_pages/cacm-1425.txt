flow diagrams turing machines and
languages with only two formation rules

in the first part of the paper flow diagrams
are introduced to represent inter al mappings 
of a set into itself  although not every diagram is
decomposable into a finite number of given base 
diagrams this becomes true at a semantical level due
to a suitable extension of the given set and of 
the basic mappings defined in it  two normalization
methods of flow diagrams are given  the first has 
three base diagrams the second only two  in the second
part of the paper the second method is applied 
to the theory of turing machines  with every turing
machine provided with a two-way half-tape there 
is associated a similar machine doing essentially
the same job but working on a tape obtained from 
the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares
 the new machine belongs to the family elsewhere 
introduced generated by composition and iteration from
the two machines l and r  that family is a proper 
subfamily of the whole family of turing machines
