hydra the kernel of a multiprocessor operating system

this paper describes the design philosophy of
hydra-the kernel of an operating system for cmmp 
the carnegie-mellon multi-mini-processor  this philosophy
is realized through the introduction of a 
generalized notion of resource both physical and virtual
called an object  mechanisms are presented 
for dealing with objects including the creation of new
types specification of new operations applicable 
to a given type sharing and protection of any reference
to a given object against improper application 
of any of the operations defined with respect to that
type of object  the mechanisms provide a coherent 
basis for extension of the system in two directions the
introduction of new facilities and the creation 
of highly secure systems
