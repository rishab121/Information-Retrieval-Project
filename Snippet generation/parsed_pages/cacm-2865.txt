verifying properties of parallel programs an axiomatic approach

an axiomatic method for proving a number
of properties of parallel programs is presented  
hoare has given a set of axioms for partial correctness
but they are not strong enough in most cases 
 this paper defines a more powerful deductive system which
is in some sense complete for partial correctness 
 a crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables
which are added to a parallel program as 
an aid to proving it correct  the information in a partial
correctness proof can be used to prove such 
properties as mutual exclusion freedom from deadlock
and program termination  techniques for verifying 
these properties are presented and illustrated by
application to the dining philosophers problem
