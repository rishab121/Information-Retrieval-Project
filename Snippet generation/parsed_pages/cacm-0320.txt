logic-structure tables

logic tables are an excellent way of developing
and expressing the logic required in procedures 
operations systems and circuits  a set of rules for
writing and using logic tables is explained by 
means of some simple examples  then the logic structure
of a vending machine is given in which two logic 
tables are used  logic tables are two-dimensional in
nature enabling us to fully express and consider 
both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic  they
can be compiled directly into a computer program 
and so eliminate the need for flow charting and hand coding
