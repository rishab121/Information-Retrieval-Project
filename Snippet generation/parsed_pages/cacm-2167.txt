algebraic simplification a guide for the perplexed

algebraic simplification is examined first from
the point of view of a user who needs to comprehend 
a large expression and second from the point of view
of a designer who wants to construct a useful and 
efficient system  first we describe various techniques
akin to substitution  these techniques can be 
used to decrease thesize of an expression and make it
more intelligible to a user  then we delineate 
the spectrum of approaches to the design of automatic simplification
capabilities in an algebraic manipulation 
system  systems are divided into five types  each type
provides different facilities for the manipulation 
and simplification of expressions finally we discuss
some of the theoretical results related to algebraic 
simplification  we describe several positive results
about the existence of powerful simplification 
algorithms and the number-theoretic conjectures on which
they rely  results about the nonexistence of 
algorithms for certain classes of expressions are included
