programming semantics for multiprogrammed computations

the semantics are defined for a number of meta-instructions
which perform operation essential 
to the writing of programs in multiprogrammed computer
systems  these meta-instructions relate to parallel 
processing protection of separate computations program
debugging and the sharing among users of memory 
segments and other computing objects the names of which
are hierarchically structured  the language 
sophistication contemplated is midway between an assembly
language and an advanced algebraic language
