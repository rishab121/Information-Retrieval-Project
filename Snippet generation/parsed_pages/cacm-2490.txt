efficient algorithms for graph manipulation h algorithm a447

efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning
a graph into connected components biconnected 
components and simple paths  the algorithm for partitioning
of a graph into simple paths is iterative 
and each iteration produces a new path between two
vertices already on paths  the start vertex can 
be specified dynamically  if v is the number of vertices
and e is the number of edges each algorithm 
requires time and space proportional to max ve
when executed on a random access computer
