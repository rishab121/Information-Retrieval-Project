sp/k a system for teaching computer programming

sp/k is a compatible subset of the pl/i  language
that has been designed for teaching programming 
the features of the sp/k language were chosen to encourage
structured problem solving by computers to 
make the language easy to learn and use to eliminate
confusing and redundant constructs and to make 
the language easy to compile  the resulting language
is suitable for in troducing programming concepts 
used in various applications including business data
processing scientific calculations and non-numeric 
computation  sp/k is actually a sequence of language
subsets called sp/1 sp/2p/8  each subset 
in troduces new programming language constructs while
retaining all the constructs of preceding subsets 
each subset is precisely defined and can be learned
or implemented without the following subsets
