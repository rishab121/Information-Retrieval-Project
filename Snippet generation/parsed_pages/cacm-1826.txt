a lisp garbage-collector for virtual-memory computer systems

in this paper a garbage-collection algorithm
for list-processing systems which operate within 
very large virtual memories is described  the object
of the algorithm is more the compaction of active 
storage than the discovery of free storage  because free
storage is never really exhausted the decision 
to garbage collect is not easily made therefore
various criteria of this decision are discussed
