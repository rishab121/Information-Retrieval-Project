properties of linear multistep formulas

this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy
of families of linear k-step formulas depending 
on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical
solution of stiff ordinary differential equations 
 an upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy
of ainf-stable formulas  three criteria 
are given for a0-stability  it is shown that 1 for
pk k arbitrary ainf-stability implies certain 
necessary conditions for a0-stability and for strict
stability meaning that the extraneous roots of 
ppsi satisfy psi1 2 for pk2,3,4and 5 ainf-stability
for k5 together with another constraint 
implies strict stability and 3 for certain one-parameter
classes of formulas with pk3,4and/or 5 
ainf-stability implies a0-stability
