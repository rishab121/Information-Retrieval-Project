full table quadratic searching for scatter storage

the quadratic residue search method for hash tables avoids much
of the clustering experienced with a linear search method  the simple
quadratic search only accesses half the table  it has been shown
that when the length of the table is a prime of the form 4n+3 where n 
is an integer the whole table may be accessed by two quadratic
searches plus a separate access for the original entry point a search 
method is presented which is computationally simple has all the advantages 
of the quadratic search and yet accesses all the table in one sweep
