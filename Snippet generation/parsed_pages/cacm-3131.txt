focus microcomputer number system

focus is a number system and supporting computational
algorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and other
signal processing applications  focus has the wide-ranging
character of floating-point numbers with a uniformity of state distributions
that give focus better than a twofold accuracy advantage
over an equal word length floating-point system  focus computations
are typically five times faster than single precision fixed-point
or integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations comparable in
speed with hardware arithmetic for many applications  algorithms
for 8-bit and 16-bit implementations of focus are included
