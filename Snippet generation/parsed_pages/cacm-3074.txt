a time and space efficient garbage compaction algorithm

given an area of storage containing scattered
marked nodes of differing sizes one may wish 
to rearrange them into a compact mass at one end of the
area while revising all pointers to marked nodes 
to show their new locations  an algorithm is described
here which accomplishes this task in linear time 
relative to the size of the storage area and in a space
of the order of one bit for each pointer  the 
algorithm operates by reversibly encoding the situation
that a collection of locations point to a single 
location by a linear list emanating from the pointed-to
location passing through the pointing locations 
and terminating with the pointed-to locations transplanted contents
