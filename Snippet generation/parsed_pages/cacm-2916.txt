a fast string searching algorithm

an algorithm is presented that searches for
the location i of the first occurrence of a 
character string pat in another string string
 during the search operation the characters of 
pat are matched starting with the last character of
pat  the information gained by starting the match 
at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm
to proceed in large jumps through the text being 
searched  thus the algorithm has the unusual property that
in most cases not all of the first i characters 
of string are inspected  the number of characters actually
inspected on the average decreases as a 
function of the length of pat  for a random english
pattern of length 5 the algorithm will typically 
inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at
i  furthermore the algorithm has been implemented 
so that on the average fewer than i+patlen machine
instructions are executed  these conclusions are 
supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical
analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm 
 the worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in
i+patlen assuming the availability of array space 
for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet
