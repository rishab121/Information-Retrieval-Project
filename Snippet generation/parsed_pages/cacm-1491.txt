euler a generalization algol and its formal definition part i

a method for defining programming languages is
developed which introduces a rigorous relationship 
between structure and meaning  the structure of a
language is defined by a phrase structure syntax 
the meaning in terms of the effects which the execution
of a sequence of interpretation rules exerts 
upon a fixed set of variables called the environment
 there exists a one-to-one correspondence between 
syntactic rules and interpretation rules is determined by
the sequence of corresponding syntactic reductions 
which constitute a parse  the individual interpretation
rules are explained in terms of an elementary 
an d obvious algorithmic notation  a constructive
method for evaluating a text is provided and for 
certain decidable classes of languages their unambiguity
is proved  as an example a generalization 
of algol is described in full detail to demonstrate that
concepts like block-structure procedures parameters 
etc can be defined adequately and precisely by this method
