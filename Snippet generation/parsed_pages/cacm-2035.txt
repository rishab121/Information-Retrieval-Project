lap6 is an on-line system running on a 2048-word linc which provides full 
facilities for text editing automatic filing and file maintenance and 
program preparation and assembly  it focuses on the preparation and editing 
of continuously displayed 23,040-character text strings manuscripts which
can be positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding
and deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll
other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can 
be augmented by the user  the machine although small
aids program design by providing display scope and premarked
randomly addressable linc tapes as standard items in an environment
similar to that of a sophisticated terminal  the tapes are logically 
similar to a disk  priority was given to the design of efficient
tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory  techniques 
developed for handling scroll editing filing and the layered system 
structure are outlined  lap6 is used by about 2000 people in 11 countries  
its design was strongly influenced by performance criteria established in 
interviews held with linc users themselves during the specification period
