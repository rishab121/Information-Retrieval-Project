two-level control structure for nondeterministic programming

the basic ideas of nondeterministic programming
are critically reconsidered to single out a 
proper attitude and programming style for language allowing
direct control of nondeterministic features 
 the proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of
the nondeterministic formulation of search processes 
on one level the attempt level deferring the coordination
of problem solving efforts to another the 
choice level  the feasibility of recognizing these two
levels is discussed stressing that the structure 
to be managed at the choice level is a free of contexts
 the leaves are computational environments 
each holding an alternative under inspection while
the other nodes are associated with choice poin ts 
 according to the proposed programming style a generative
function is associated with each choice poin t 
which expresses the desired choice strategy the main
advantage on this approach is the localization 
of the search strategies each nonterminal node of the
tree keeps track of the state of the computation 
as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated
holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate 
the available alternatives  examples are given in
term of nd-lisp an extension of lisp designed and 
implemented according to these guidelines
