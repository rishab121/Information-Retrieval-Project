conversion of decision tables to computer
programs by rule mark techniques

the rule mask technique is one method of converting
limited entry decision tables to computer 
programs  recent discussion suggest that in many circumstances
it is to be preferred to the technique 
of constructing networks or trees  a drawback of the
technique as hitherto presented is its liability 
to produce object programs of longer run time than necessary
 in this paper a modification of the technique 
is discussed which takes into account both rule frequencies
and the relative times for evaluating conditions 
 this can materially improve object program run time
