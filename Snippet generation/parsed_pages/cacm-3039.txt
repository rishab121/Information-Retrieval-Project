on-the-fly garbage collection an exercise in cooperation

as an example of cooperation between sequential
processes with very little mutual interference 
despite frequent manipulations of a large shared data
space  a technique is developed which allows nearly 
all of the activity needed for garbage detection and collection
to be performed by an additional processor 
operating con-currently with the processor devoted to the
computation proper  exclusion and synchronization 
constraints have been kept as weak as could be achieved
the severe complexities engendered by doing 
so are illustrated
