trace-driven modeling and analysis of
cpu scheduling in multiprogramming system

microscopic level job stream data obtained in
a production environment by an event-driven software 
probe is used to drive a model of a multiprogramming
computer system  the cpu scheduling algorithm of 
the model is systematically varied  this technique
called trace-driven modeling provides an accurate 
replica of a production environment for the testing of variations
in the system  at the same time alterations 
in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in a
controlled way with cause and effects relationships 
being isolated  the scheduling methods tested included
the best possible and worst possible methods 
the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory round-robin
first-come-first-served etc and dynamic 
predictors  the relative and absolute performances of
these scheduling methods are given  it is concluded 
that a successful cpu scheduling method must be preemptive
and must prevent a given job from holding 
the cpu for too long a period
