growing applications of linear programming

use of linear programming models has grown so
extensively in recent years that the whole concept 
for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical
change  it no longer is adequate merely to reduce 
a mathematical algorithm ie the simplex method to
a computer code  an advanced code must cope with 
such a variety of situations that the respective computer
subprograms must be organized into an integrated 
system  emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying
principles upon which future linear programming 
systems must be based  these viewpoints are influenced
by the new demands that applications within the 
petroleum industry are placing on such systems  some
of the components of such a system are translation 
of problem statement in terms of basic data to linear
programming matrix coefficients data transmission 
for direct computer entry data file at the computer center
data processing and editing prior to solving 
the simplex algorithm an efficient and reliable code
for solving the above-mentioned algorithm and 
flexible means for summarizing the results
