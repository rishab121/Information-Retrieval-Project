of the system which is intended for the solution of scientific
problems are the presentation of mathematical 
formulas entirely in standard textbook notation  the use
of plain english for organizational instructions

of the error in the uncompiled program and 
an attempt to minimize that fragmentation of the original
problem statement which is a normal feature
