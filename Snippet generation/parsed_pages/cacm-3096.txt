an optimal method for deletion in one-sided height-balanced trees

a one-sided height-balanced tree is a binary
tree in which every nodes right subtree has a 
height which is equal to or exactly one greater than the
height of its left subtree  it has an advantage 
over the more general avl tree in that only one bit
of balancing information is required two bits are 
required for the acl tree  it is shown that deletion of
an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished 
in ologn operations where n is the number of nodes
in the tree  moreover the method is optimal in 
the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order
of magnitude  this result coupled with earlier 
results by hirschberg indicates that of the three basic
problems of insertion deletion and retrieval 
only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an avl tree
