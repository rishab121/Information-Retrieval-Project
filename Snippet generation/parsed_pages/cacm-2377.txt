a hardware architecture for implementing protection rings

protection of computations and information
is an important aspect of a computer utility  in 
a system which uses segmentation as a memory addressing
scheme protection can be achieved in part by 
associating concentric rings of decreasing access privilege
with a computation  this paper describes 
hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these rings
of protection  the mechanisms for implementing 
these rings of protection the mechanisms allow cross-ring
calls and subsequent returns to occur without 
trapping to the supervisor  automatic hardware validation
of references across ring boundaries is also 
performed  thus a call by a user procedure to a protected
subsystem including the supervisor is identical 
to a call to a companion user procedure  the mechanisms
of passing and referencing arguments are the 
same in both cases as well
