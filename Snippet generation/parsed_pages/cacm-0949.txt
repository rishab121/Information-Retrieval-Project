integer and signed constants in algol

a few remarks are given on the relations between
syntax and semantics in the programming languages 
 the aim is to point out that if it is true that the grammar
of a context-free language should be conceived 
not only as a strings-generating device but also as a
method for expressing a meaning then the grammar 
of algol is open to some criticism
