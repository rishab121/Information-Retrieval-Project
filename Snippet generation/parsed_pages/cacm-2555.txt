variable-precision exponentiation

a previous paper presented an efficient algorithm
called the recomputation algorithm for 
evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance
on a computer which performs variable-precision 
arithmetic operations  the recomputation algorithm can be
applied to expressions involving any variable-precision 
operations having o10^-p + sumei error bounds
where p denotes the operations precision and 
ei denotes the error in the operations ith argument
 this paper presents an efficient variable-precision 
exponential operation with an error bound of the above
order  other operations such as log sin and 
cos which have simple series expansions can be handled similarly
