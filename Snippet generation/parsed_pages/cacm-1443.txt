a method for finding the least squares estimate
of the intersection point of two helices in space

when the helical trajectories of two charged
particles moving away from a common point in a 
magnetic field are reconstructed from measurements on
the tracks the reconstructed tracks are perturbed 
by measurement and other errors and do not in general
intersect  a method is given for adjusting the 
reconstructed tracks in a least squares manner so that they do intersect
