an information-theoretic approach to
text searching in direct access systems

using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information an attempt is made to overcome 
one of the problems often associated with information
retrieval namely the maintenance and use of large 
dictionaries the greater part of which is used only
infrequently  a novel method is presented which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution  this is
more suited to implementation on storage devices 
 this method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types  the members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval
the rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages
