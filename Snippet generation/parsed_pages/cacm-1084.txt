on declaring arbitrarily coded alphabets

the inability of existing programming languages
to handle character strings from more than 
one or two alphabets is mentioned and a scheme for declaring
additional alphabets is proposed  the scheme 
provides for many-to-one encodings right or left
justification collating sequences different from 
numeric sequence variations in character size number
of bits from alphabet to alphabet and arbitrary 
source-language character representation
