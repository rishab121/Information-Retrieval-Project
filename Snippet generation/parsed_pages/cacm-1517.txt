methods for analyzing data from computer simulation experiments

this paper addresses itself to the problem of
analyzing data generated by computer simulations 
of economic systems  we first turn to a hypothetical firm
whose operation is represented by  single-channel 
multistation queueing model  the firm seeks to maximize
total expected profit for the coming period 
by selecting one of five operating plans where each
plan incorporates a certain marketing strategy 
an allocation of productive inputs and a total cost
 the results of the simulated activity under each 
plan are subjected to an f-test two multiple comparison
methods and a multiple ranking method  we 
illustrate compare and evaluate these techniques
 the paper adopts the position that the particular 
technique of analysis possibly not any one of the above
chosen by the experimenter should be an expression 
of his experimental objective the f-test tests the homogeneity
of the plans multiple comparison methods 
quantify their differences and multiple ranking methods
directly identify the one best plan or best 
plans
