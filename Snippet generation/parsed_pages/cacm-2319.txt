operating system performance

an overview of the current and future positions
with respect to operating system performance 
is given  while a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed 
gaps still exist in out knowledge  because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future 
 such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems
