performance of systems used for data transmission
transfer rate of information bits -an asa tutorial 
standard

information thruput as a characteristic of
systems performance is discussed  this discussion 
includes the pertinent aspects of information transfer
of determination of transfer rate of information 
bits trib of residual errors and of standard measurement
conditions  the paper also presents an 
orderly arrangement of characteristics and parameters
that affect information thruput and some examples 
on procedures for determining a thruput rate in terms of
trib  it concludes that a performance characteristic 
involving information rate can best be expressed as the
trib in conjunction with the residual error rate
