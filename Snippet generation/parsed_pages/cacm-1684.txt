ambiguity in limited entry decision tables

the use of decision tables as a tool in systems
analysis and for program specification is now 
becoming accepted  rules on redundancy contradiction
and completeness for limited entry tables were 
published in 1963  these are usually used for checking
preceded if necessary by a conversion from extended 
to limited entry form  processors which automatically
translate tables to more conventional program 
usually base their diagnostic facilities on these rules
 in this paper it is suggested that these rules 
are unsatisfactory and that the important aspect of
checking is to eliminate ambiguity from tables  
ambiguity is defined and discussed and a procedure for
producing checked-out decision tables is proposed 
 the theoretical basis of the algorithm used is established
the importance of well-designed diagnostic 
facilities in decision table processors is emphasized
