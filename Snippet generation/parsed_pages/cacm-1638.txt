sorting by replacement selecting

in sorting by replacement selecting the expected
length of a sequence beginning with the i-th 
element i1 is proved to be 2f in accordance with
a conjecture of e h friend where f is the number 
of memory cells used  the expected length of the j-th
sequence is determined to be f times a j-th degree 
polynomial in e such that the value of this polynomial
approaches 2 as j approaches infinity  recursive 
formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard
deviation of the length of the j-th sequence 
 the mathematical proofs of these results are based
upon the assumption that n the number of items to 
be sorted is infinite but it is shown that the error
due to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly 
as n increases
