a computer technique for displaying n-dimensional hyperobjects

a digital computer and automatic plotter have
been used to generate three-dimensional stereoscopic 
movies of the three-dimensional parallel and perspective
projections of four-dimensional hyperobjects 
rotating in four-dimensional space  the observed projections
and their motions were a direct extension
of three-dimensional experience but no profound feeling
or insight into the fourth spatial dimension 
was obtained  the technique can be generalized to n-dimensions
and applied to any n-dimensional hyperobject 
or hypersurface
