automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level

setl is a set-theoretically oriented language
of very high level whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets ordered n-tuples and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings  this 
paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this
language  among other methods of interest the 
optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion
and membership to be established the domains 
and ranges of tabulated mappings to be estimated from
above and below and the single-valuedness of 
tabulated mappings to be proved  once facts of this
kind have been established automatic choice of 
data structures becomes possible the methods employed
are based upon and extend known techniques of 
data flow analysis
