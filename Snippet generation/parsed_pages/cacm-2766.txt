copying cyclic list structures in linear time using bounded workspace

a bounded workspace copying algorithm for arbitrary
list structures is given  this algorithm 
operates in linear time and does not require tag bits 
the best previous bounded workspace copying algorithms 
achieved n^2 time without tag bits and n log n time with
one tag  the only restriction on the algorithm 
given here is that the copy must be placed into a contiguous
section of memory  the method is applicable 
to fixed or variable size nodes
