reduction of a band-symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem

an algorithm is described for reducing the
generalized eigenvalue problem ax  lambda bx to 
an ordinary problem in case a and b are symmetric band
matrices with b positive definite  if n is the 
order of the matrix and m the bandwidth the matrices
a and b are partitioned into m-by-m blocks and 
the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks
 the algorithm reduces the generalized problem to 
an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band
matrix c whose bandwidth is the same as a and b 
 the algorithm is similar to those of rutishauser and
schwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices 
to band form  the calculation c requires order mn^2
operation  the round-off error in the calculation 
of c is of the same order as the sum of the errors at
each of the n/m steps of the algorithm the latter 
errors being largely determined by the condition of b with respect to inversion
