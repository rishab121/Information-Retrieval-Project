a language extension for expressing constraints on data access

controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms  this
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing  the extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data 
 access constraints can apply both to simple objects and
to objects that are components of larger objects 
such as bank account records in a banks data base
 the constraints are stated declaratively and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking
 the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types
