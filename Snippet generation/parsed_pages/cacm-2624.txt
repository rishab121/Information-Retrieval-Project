formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures

virtual machine systems have been implemented
on a limited number of third generation computer 
systems eg cp-67 on the ibm 360/67  from previous
empirical studies it is known that certain third 
generation computer systems eg the dec pdp-10 cannot
support a virtual machine system  in this paper 
model of a third-generation-like computer system is
developed  formal techniques are used to derive 
precise sufficient conditions to test whether such
an architecture can support virtual machines
