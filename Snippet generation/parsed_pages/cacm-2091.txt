pdel-a language for partial differential equations

conventional computer methods available to solve
continuous system problems characterized by partial
differential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome  a
convenient easy to learn and to use high level problem oriented
language to solve and study partial differential equation problems
has been designed a practical translator for the language has also
been designed and a working version of it has been constructed
for a significant portion of the language  this partial differential
equation language pdel is outlined and the highlights
of the translator are briefly summarized
