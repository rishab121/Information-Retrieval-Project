an efficient machine-independent procedure for
garbage collection in various list structures

a method for returning registers to the free
list is an essential part of any list processing 
system  in this paper past solutions of the recovery
problem are reviewed and compared  a new algorithm 
is presented which offers significant advantages of speed
and storage utilization  the routine for implementing 
this algorithm can be written in the list language with
which it is to be used thus insuring a degree 
of machine independence  finally the application of the
algorithm to a number of different list structures 
appearing in the literature is indicated
