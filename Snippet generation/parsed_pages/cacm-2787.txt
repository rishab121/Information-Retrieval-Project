matrix reduction-an efficient method

the paper describes an efficient method for
reduction of the binary matrices which arise in 
some school time-tabling problems  it is a development
of that described by john lions  it has been 
generalized and adapted to fit into the complete timetabling
process to use a more compact data representation 
and more efficient processing techniques to take fuller
advantage of possible available previous knowledge 
about the matrix  and it is designed as a structured
program which can readily be coded by the reader 
in the high level or low level programming language
of his choice  practical tests of the method have 
shown it to be a good basis for a realistic timetabling algorithm
