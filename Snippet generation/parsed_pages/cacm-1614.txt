a proposal for definitions in algol

an extension to algol is proposed for adding
new data types and operators to the language 
 definitions may occur in any block heading and terminate
with the block  they are an integral part 
of the program and are not fixed in the language  even
the behavior of existing operators may be redefined 
 the processing of text containing defined contexts features
a replacement rule that eliminates unnecessary 
iterations and temporary storage  examples of definition sets
are given for real and complex matrices 
complex numbers file processing and list manipulation
