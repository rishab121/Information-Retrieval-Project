programming decision tables in fortran cobol or algol

a simple broad-based approach for programming
decision tables in fortran or cobol is developed 
and presented  with inputs in standard form as defined
in the paper the programming of any decision 
table can be done with one or two fortran statements
or with two cobol statements if the compute verb 
is available in the cobol processor  it is  shown
that the method is applicable even when there are 
more than two mutually exclusive states of one two or
more table conditions  it is further shown that 
multi-state conditions in decision tables can often
simplify the programming  the method outlined has 
the further advantage that all possible combinations
of conditions are considered  it is shown that 
the suggested procedure is easily implemented in algol
