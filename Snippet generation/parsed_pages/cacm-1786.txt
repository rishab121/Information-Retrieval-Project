an improved hash code for scatter storage

introduced is a hash coding method based on
fixed-point division rather than multiplication 
or logical operations  this new method allows the
hash table to have almost any length  also a new 
method of handling collisions is discussed  known as
quadratic search this method is faster than random 
search and free from the clusters that build up with a linear search
