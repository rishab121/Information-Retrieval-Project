state-space problem-reduction and theorem proving-some relationships

this paper suggests a bidirectional relationship
between state-space and problem-reduction 
representations it presents a formalism based on multiple-input
and multiple-output operators which 
provides a basis for viewing the two types of representations
in this manner  a representation of the 
language recognition problem which is based on the cocke
parsing algorithm is used as an illustration 
 a method for representing problems in first-order logic
in such a way that the inference system employed 
by a resolution-based theorem prover determines whether
the set of clauses is interpreted in the state-spacer 
mode or in the problem-reduction mode is presented
 the analogous concepts in problem-reduction and 
theorem proving and the terminology used to refer to them
are noted  the relationship between problem-reduction 
input resolution and linear resolution is discussed
