computer-drawn flowcharts

to meet the need for improved documentation
of written computer programs a simple system for 
effective communication is presented which has shown
great promise  the programmer describes his program 
in a simple format and the computer prepares flow charts
and other cross-referenced listings from this 
input  the description can be kept up-to-date easily
and the final output clearly explains the original 
program  the system has also proved to be a valuable debugging and coding aid
