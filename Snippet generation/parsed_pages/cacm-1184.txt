a fast storage allocator

a fast storage bookkeeping method is described
which is particularly appropriate for list-structure 
operations and other situations involving many sizes
of blocks that are fixed in size and location  
 this scheme used in the llllll or l6 bell telephone laboratories
low-level list language makes available 
blocks of computer registers in several different sizes
the smaller blocks are obtained by successively 
splitting larger ones in half and the larger blocks are reconstituted
if and when their parts are simultaneously 
free
