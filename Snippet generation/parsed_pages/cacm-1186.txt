recursive solution of a class of combinatorial problems an example

combinatorial problems requiring the selection
of n elements from a set of m elements may be 
solved by a recursion process analogous to that for
computing binomial coefficients  several specific 
problems are analyzed the general technique is exposed
and an algol program is developed for one of 
the problems
