decomposability instabilities and
saturation in multiprogramming systems

a step-by-step approach to model the dynamic
behavior and evaluate the performance of computing 
systems is proposed  it is based on a technique of variable
aggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable 
system both borrowed from econometrics  this approach
is taken in order to identify in multiprogramming 
paging systems i unstable regimes of operations and ii
critical computing loads which bring the system 
into states of saturation  this analysis leads to a
more complete definition of the circumstances in 
which thrashing can set in
