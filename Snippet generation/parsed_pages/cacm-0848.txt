a note on range transformations for square root and logarithm

there was the germ of an idea in two previous
papers 1,2 which no one seems to have picked 
up in almost five years  for certain functions it seems
desirable to transform the argument to a short 
range symmetric about 10.1 will give examples of this
usage for the square root and logarithm function 
for both binary and decimal machines
