toward a discipline of real-time programming

programming is divided into three major categories
with increasing complexity of reasoning 
in program validation sequential programming multiprogramming
and real-time programming  by adhering 
to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitable
high-level language molded after this discipline 
the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution
time constrain ts may be drastically reduced 
 this may be the only practical way to make real-time
systems analytically verifiable and ultimately 
reliable  a possible discipline is outlined and
expressed in terms of the language modula
