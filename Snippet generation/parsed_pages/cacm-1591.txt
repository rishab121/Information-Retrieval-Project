a model for a multifunctional teaching system

a teaching system model that was incorporated
into an operating system of a large computer 
is described  the model transferred control to the
operating system to execute functions other than 
teaching and then recovered control in order to resume
teaching  the teaching system abac-ii was 
written to run under the operating system ibsys for
the ibm 7044 graphic system  because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode  during the latter the 
full resources of the operating system language processors
compilers library and users programs 
were at his disposal  he could for example write assemble
debug and execute at the terminal a program 
written in any language processed by the operating system
 a course could therefore include text material 
interleaved with programming problems which the student
could solve without leaving the terminal  exercises 
in simulation and gaming could also be provided  the
implications of a teaching system with this degree 
of flexibility for industrial and executive training
as well as academic education are discussed  in 
addition the advantages of this type of system for computer
programming and operation are also considered
