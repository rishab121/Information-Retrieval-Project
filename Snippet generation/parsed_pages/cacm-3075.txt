fast parallel sorting algorithms

a parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time olog n and the use of n 
processors  the algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time  a realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted  a procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time ok log
n using n 1 + 1/k processors for k an arbitrary 
integer  the model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location
