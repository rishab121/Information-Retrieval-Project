toward a general theory of special functions

a list of a number of natural developments
for the field of algebraic manipulation is given 
 then the prospects for a general theory of functions
defined by ordinary differential equations are 
discussed  the claim is made that recent developments
in mathematics indicate that it should be possible 
to algorithmically generate many properties of solutions
to differential equations  such a theory is 
preferable to a less general effort to make algebraic
manipulation systems knowledgeable about the usual 
special functions eg exponential hypergeometric
