digital data processor for tracking the partially illuminated moon

a study of lunar tracking techniques and fabrication
of a breadboard to assess the feasibility 
of the best technique selected was conducted to define
a tracking system for observation of the sight line 
to the center of a partially illuminated moon  the
data processing portion of the system is presented 
in detail and then described in general are the operation
of the tracker head assembly for data readout 
the operation of the entire system and the effect data
processing considerations have on the design of 
the tracker system  the system basically consists of
an optical sensor digital computer and tracker 
drive mechanism  the three system units connected
in cascade comprise the control loop  for this 
application an optical telescope with a radial mechanical
scanning mechanism was used that read out 
lunar sight line measurement information  this information
is sequentially read into a special purpose 
digital computer that extracts the measurements and
computes the error signals that drive the tracker 
to the appropriate attitude
