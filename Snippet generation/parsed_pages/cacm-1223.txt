high speed compilation of efficient object code

a three-pass compiler with the following properties
is briefly described  the last two passes 
scan an intermediate language produced by the preceding
pass in essentially the reverse of the order 
in which it was generated so that the first pass is the
only one which hasto read the bulky problem-oriented 
input  the double scan one in either direction performed
by the first two passes allows the compiler 
to remove locally constant expressions and recursively
calculable expressions from loops and to do the 
important part of common subexpression recognition
 optimization such as the effective use of index 
registers although as important is not discussed since
the object code which would be most efficient 
is highly machine dependent  the discussion is in terms
of a fortran-like language although the technique 
is applicable to most algebraic languages
