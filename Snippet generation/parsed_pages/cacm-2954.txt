a bounded storage algorithm for copying cyclic structures

a new algorithm is presented which copies cyclic
list structures using bounded workspace and 
linear time unlike a previous similar algorithm this
one makes no assumptions about the storage allocation 
system in use and uses only operations likely to be available
in a high-level language  the distinctive 
feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversing
the structure twice using the same spanning 
tree in each case first from left to right and then from right to left
