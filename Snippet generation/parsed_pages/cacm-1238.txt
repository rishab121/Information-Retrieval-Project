a technique for integrated reports from a multi-run system

the requirements of a requisition accounting
system for the san francisco overseas supply agency 
osa included exception reporting to osa itself  the simultaneous
satisfaction of the reporting requirement 
and the accounting requirements posed definite problems
in system design particularly the handling of 
the reporting function  a practical and satisfactory
solution was developed by expanding the basic system 
with two tailored service runs for report production
 these two runs permitted a final system that was 
easier to debug easy to maintain efficient in production
and responsive to the changing requirements
of osa
