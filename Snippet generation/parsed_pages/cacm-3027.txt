the development of the mu5 computer system

following a brief outline of the background
of the mu5 project the aims and ideas for mu5 
are discussed  a description is then given of the instruction
set which includes a number of features 
conducive to the production of efficient compiled code
from high-level language source programs  the 
design of the processor is then traced from the initial
ideas for an associatively addressed name store 
to the final multistage pipeline structure involving
a prediction mechanism for instruction prefetching 
and a function queue for array element accessing  an
overall view of the complete mu5 complex is presented 
together with a brief indication of its performance
