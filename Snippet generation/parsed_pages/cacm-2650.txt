order-n correction for regular languages

a method is presented for calculating a string
b belonging to a given regular language l 
which is nearest in number of edit operations to a
given input string a  b is viewed as a reasonable 
correction for the possibly erroneous string a where
a was originally intended to be a string of l 
 the calculation of b by the method presented requires
time proportional to a the number of characters 
in a  the method should find applications in information
retrieval artificial intelligence and spelling 
correction systems
