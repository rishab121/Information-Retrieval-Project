concurrent control with readers and writers

the problem of the mutual exclusion of several
independent processes from simultaneous access 
to a critical section is discussed for the case where
there are two distinct classes of processes known 
as readers and writers  the readers may share
the section with each other but the writers must 
have exclusive access  two solutions are presented
one of the case where we wish minimum delay for 
the readers the other for the case where we wish
writing to take place as early as possible
